1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,306
Ruby's color of blood.

2
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:10,510
Hitler had it made for Ava Brown.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,492
You're the only person in the world

4
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:17,204
who knows where that sub is. Now.

5
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:18,922
They're no longer just thieves.

6
00:00:18,923 --> 00:00:20,394
They're murderers.

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,520
Somebody's always just one jump ahead of us.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,314
During the war, he was called the elephant.

9
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:29,350
Your life is in extreme danger.

10
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,090
So that's where the money I give you goes, madame.

11
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:12,972
And I had hoped it would go to some

12
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:17,036
mysterious lady or even the wife of another man.

13
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,830
Madame, I assure you, only horses.

14
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,012
I.

15
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:23,612
Take a bottle of rouge to my

16
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:26,082
friends and clear up the debris.

17
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,802
And don't give them any racing tips. Promise?

18
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:30,370
Yes, madame.

19
00:02:30,371 --> 00:04:12,430
Of that it's.

20
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,560
Are you going to tell me?

21
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,910
Try and follow him. Stephen.

22
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,830
Are you hurt?

23
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,360
Schroeder. It. Come on.

24
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,160
There you go.

25
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,494
Discomfort now, Mr. Schura?

26
00:06:12,495 --> 00:06:14,770
Than a nasty infection afterwards.

27
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,992
I'm three. Got away.

28
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:22,384
Oh, well, you must inform the police, Mr. Shirley. No.

29
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:23,420
Why not?

30
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,832
Our apartment was burgled two days ago.

31
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,366
Since then, I've wasted too much time with the police.

32
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:30,460
What do they get?

33
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,730
40 francs?

34
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,188
They break in just for that, did they?

35
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:36,850
What were they looking for?

36
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:37,972
I have no idea.

37
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:40,930
You got any idea where that guy wanted to beat you up?

38
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:41,860
It was chance.

39
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:43,178
My bad luck.

40
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:44,442
I was in the alley.

41
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:46,266
The man was waiting.

42
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:47,316
It could have happened to anyone.

43
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:48,852
It happened to you.

44
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:52,310
Your apartment has been burgled and been beaten up.

45
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,528
What comes next?

46
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:55,010
My wife is waiting.

47
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,010
She will be very worried.

48
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,380
Excuse me, please.

49
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,176
Thank you again. Good night, Mr.

50
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:04,130
Hamade.

51
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,130
Good night, madame.

52
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,346
Nazi Benus.

53
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:29,216
It's just remotely possible that not all Germans of Mr.

54
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:31,392
Schroeder's age were Nazis. Of course not.

55
00:07:31,393 --> 00:07:33,072
They were just living there.

56
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:36,436
When their fura said jump, they told him, go away.

57
00:07:36,437 --> 00:07:38,132
Mind your own business.

58
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:40,602
Oh, how about minding mine accurately?

59
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:41,710
Yes, madam.

60
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,870
He's very respectable.

61
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,186
Used to have a restaurant.

62
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:54,696
But he can't work anymore because he had heart attack.

63
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:56,654
What do you want me to do, give him a pension?

64
00:07:56,655 --> 00:07:57,976
Well, he could use one.

65
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,678
He's got nothing but trouble.

66
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,448
I've been buying antiques from him and

67
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,450
he hasn't got any of them left.

68
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,356
He's got a young wife, though.

69
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:07,050
Very extravagant.

70
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:08,524
I've had frEe.

71
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:11,010
You remember I sent him to you with some paintings?

72
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:12,572
Yeah, sure I do.

73
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:16,256
I saw bad imitation Matisse. Worth nothing.

74
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:20,038
No, he was worried, nervous, handpecked.

75
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,862
How would you know he was handpicked?

76
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:22,890
Saw the wife.

77
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,812
Young French hens married to middle

78
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:29,170
aged Germans Peck harder than most.

79
00:08:29,171 --> 00:08:31,786
Now you are the loveliest woman in France.

80
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:33,600
Yes, and you never peck anybody.

81
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:56,100
Oh, don't be too sure on curfew.

82
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,960
I'll be in bed in a minute.

83
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,520
That won't keep me warm.

84
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,060
Electricity is expensive.

85
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,650
Have you ever told any?

86
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,038
Everything would be so different if only you

87
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,930
would tell the police what you know.

88
00:09:19,931 --> 00:09:23,642
I'm sure they let you keep part of with

89
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:26,906
some of the money that just lying there.

90
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:30,058
Are you quite certain you haven't told anybody?

91
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:31,380
Of course I haven't.

92
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,640
But somebody knows.

93
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,610
They must.

94
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,422
Why would they bother to search this place?

95
00:09:39,423 --> 00:09:41,370
Why did that man attack me?

96
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,530
Who are they?

97
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,350
What does it matter?

98
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,578
All that matters is that you get

99
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:50,350
to the brooch before they do.

100
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,190
Then we'll have the money and it will be over. No.

101
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,110
It's from the Nazis. Blood money. I couldn't touch it.

102
00:09:59,111 --> 00:09:59,510
Right.

103
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:01,140
Let it stay there.

104
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:03,862
Get yourself beaten up again.

105
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:07,484
Make me go on scraping for every wretched Franc.

106
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:11,140
I hope it'll satisfy your stupid sense of morality.

107
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,074
What kind of a life do you think I have?

108
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:15,990
You have no job, no money.

109
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,848
We're not living, Kurt.

110
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:23,080
We're dying every day. Dying.

111
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,300
All right then.

112
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,078
All right, go ahead. Mr. Schroeder.

113
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,362
I asked to speak to you alone, Mr. Halliday.

114
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:43,506
I knew you were interested in scuba diving.

115
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:45,480
It has to be all of us or nothing.

116
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,270
What was the number of the submarine?

117
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,032
U two three seven.

118
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:56,544
She sank off the coast near here in April 1945.

119
00:10:56,545 --> 00:10:57,820
That's right. I remember.

120
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,568
She was carrying banknotes and stolen paintings to

121
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:03,892
South America to finance the last ship stand.

122
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:05,200
There she was.

123
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,026
I was in service in a communications

124
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:10,634
section of the Admiralty in Berlin.

125
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:13,066
I received the last radio signal

126
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,404
from U two three seven.

127
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,610
It stated that she was sinking

128
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:18,104
and gave her exact position.

129
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:19,864
Are you telling us you're the only person in

130
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:23,496
the world who knows where that sub is now? Correct.

131
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:26,392
Well, even if his story is tRue, the

132
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,622
money is worthless and so are the paintings.

133
00:11:28,623 --> 00:11:30,956
They've been at the bottom of the sea for 30 years.

134
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,690
Now I'm offering you a half share in a fortune.

135
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:35,772
There was one thing in that cargo that

136
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:37,762
would not have disintegrated in the sea.

137
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,490
A brooch of rubies set in gold.

138
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:44,742
Hitler had it made for Ava Brown.

139
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:46,550
It is in the form of a swastika.

140
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:49,152
Then it was valued at 100,000 pounds today.

141
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:51,020
It must be worth at least twice as much.

142
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,802
Half a million bucks.

143
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:56,400
And you expect us to believe your story?

144
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,338
Why should I lie?

145
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,240
Wait a minute.

146
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,750
That brooch did exist.

147
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,346
They asked Gurling about it at Nuremberg.

148
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:08,328
At first he pretended not to know, but when he was

149
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:12,870
pressed, he just grinned and said, why not ask the fishes?

150
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:14,310
He sure?

151
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:15,656
Of course I'm sure.

152
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:16,878
I read the transcripts.

153
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,880
20 years ago.

154
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,972
What was the name of the captain of the U?

155
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:24,204
Two three seven.

156
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:26,044
You read the report, you should know it.

157
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,400
I'm asking you.

158
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,314
Capitan Lloydnand Hans Irbach.

159
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:34,270
His second in command was Wolf Muller.

160
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:36,486
His name was included in a Sci-Fi scent

161
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:38,730
in case Irbach was killed or captured.

162
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,180
That's right.

163
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,610
Irbach.

164
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,874
Will you dive for the brooch?

165
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,916
You haven't told us where it is yet.

166
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,140
I will when you agree my terms.

167
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:54,550
Half the value.

168
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:56,472
And you keep my name out of it.

169
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:58,168
You're sure nobody else knows about this?

170
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:00,856
But yeah.

171
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:02,580
Except your wife, maybe.

172
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,140
Well, and who has she told?

173
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,616
Mr.

174
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:10,268
Marlowe hasn't been as lucky in his

175
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:12,120
choice of wives as you have.

176
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,082
He's a little biased.

177
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,284
My wife hasn't told anyone. I'm sure.

178
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:18,476
Only thing you can be sure about with women.

179
00:13:18,477 --> 00:13:19,628
You got money.

180
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:20,704
They'll get it.

181
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:22,742
Someone will, Mr. Marlowe.

182
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:24,590
Unless we get it first.

183
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:27,020
We'll let you know tonight. No.

184
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,860
I'll have nothing to do with this.

185
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,280
You worked for the Nazis, didn't you?

186
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,810
I have no alternative.

187
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:41,226
They murdered my husband.

188
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:43,120
And we already have something in common.

189
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,574
They also murdered my first wife in Auschwitz.

190
00:13:48,575 --> 00:13:49,982
She was a Jewess.

191
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:52,072
I worked for them to obtain money

192
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:53,650
to try to buy her freedom.

193
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,350
I did not know it was useless until it was too late.

194
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,140
Perhaps we have a special reason for making them pay.

195
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,900
Although we both know it can never be enough.

196
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,560
Bottle of wine, pleaSe.

197
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,320
Well, what's everybody think?

198
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,132
What he says makes sense.

199
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,504
Manous and 100,000 pounds to go a

200
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,062
long way towards building in hospital.

201
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:43,208
Yeah, and it's all just lying there

202
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:44,078
at the bottom of the sea.

203
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,650
Just waiting to be collected.

204
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,396
Say we ought to do it. What do you say?

205
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:58,162
Yes, Alex? Sure. Anush.

206
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,270
Ruby's color of blood.

207
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,080
Why not?

208
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,720
Is it real?

209
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,274
I'll tell you in a minute.

210
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,872
Well, I'm going to go down again.

211
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:23,544
Looks like everything's been falling apart for years.

212
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:24,580
You never know.

213
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,190
Well, I'd say that Schroeder

214
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:37,640
underestimated it by about 50%.

215
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,180
Please take white.

216
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:52,920
We are coming alongside.

217
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,079
Nice boat.

218
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,142
May I ask your name, please? Deb.

219
00:17:09,143 --> 00:17:10,579
Thomas Deb.

220
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,492
I should tell you that we have been observing

221
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:14,758
you and your friend for the past hour.

222
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,319
Our glasses are most powerful.

223
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,240
Like our boat.

224
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:21,386
It was as though we were

225
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:25,960
beside very enterprising of you.

226
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,300
May I see your catch, please?

227
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:29,518
Oh, sorry.

228
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,500
Not even the sardines?

229
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:34,222
We are not interested in sardines. We see.

230
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:35,210
Nor I think.

231
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,090
Please give it to me.

232
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,312
I am sure you know the law

233
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,478
of France with regard to treasure trove.

234
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,456
It is the same in England, I believe.

235
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:48,964
Anything of value found beneath the

236
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,826
sea must be declared as accustomed.

237
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:53,108
Its value will be assessed, and a proportion of

238
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:56,042
it may be given to the finder portion.

239
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:56,980
One third.

240
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,528
But only, of course, if he did not

241
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,620
try to conceal it in the first place.

242
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,100
Wouldn't dream of it.

243
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:18,708
I will give you an official receipt, if you

244
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,996
would call it the main customs building at number

245
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:25,172
ten, Rousse Anjac at any time this afternoon, and

246
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:29,592
presents his form, the duty inspector inform you of

247
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:32,968
the value and of your approximate share.

248
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:34,760
Very generous of him.

249
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:37,240
If you will sign where I have marked it.

250
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,032
You put the value at 50,000 pounds.

251
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:45,980
You disagree?

252
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,450
Well, if it is more, the experts will tell us.

253
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:53,964
Do not worry, monsieur.

254
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,580
The French government would not cheat you.

255
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:57,974
I'm relieved to hear it.

256
00:18:57,975 --> 00:19:00,450
Any more than you would cheat them. There.

257
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,050
One for you, one for us.

258
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,550
I bid you a good day.

259
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,786
Oh, by the way, if your friends

260
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:14,522
should find anything else, your friends will

261
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:17,252
be watching with their most powerful binoculars.

262
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:18,862
I'm glad you Understand.

263
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:20,222
Been a pleasure to meet you, Mr.

264
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:21,160
Dermont.

265
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:46,320
Oh, and good fishing, Tommy.

266
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,902
That's it.

267
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:50,420
Not another thing.

268
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:54,440
While we got the swastik anyway. Steve. Yeah?

269
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:55,680
Take a deep breath.

270
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:57,786
What do you think I've been doing for ten minutes?

271
00:19:57,787 --> 00:19:59,990
Well, make this the deepest one yet.

272
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,990
Take this back, then.

273
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,530
Hello?

274
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,130
They're speaking.

275
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,478
I always thought customs people are

276
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,438
supposed to be calm, pragmatic people.

277
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:18,170
I'd like to see the duty officer, please. Bad.

278
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,560
I know it's bad.

279
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:22,510
Call me back. Right.

280
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,882
I want to see the duty of. Where'd you get this?

281
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:29,680
Well, I thought they was perfectly on where? When?

282
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:31,736
Well, we were diving for coral.

283
00:20:31,737 --> 00:20:33,170
You'd better come with me.

284
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,970
Yes, better come with you.

285
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,658
So he took the swastik approach and

286
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:01,034
gave you this receipt, is that right? Yes.

287
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:03,470
We came here of our own free will. Is that right?

288
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,678
Yes, that's right. I said it's right. Don't believe us?

289
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,990
Get those guys in here.

290
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:08,564
They're your own employees.

291
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:10,900
They are not my employees.

292
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:14,280
Why, but they're in one of your boats.

293
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:18,482
It was stolen half an hour before they stopped you.

294
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:21,304
These men attacked an off duty crew.

295
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:24,822
They tied up three of my officers, and the fourth is

296
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:27,542
in hospital with a seven inch wound in his head.

297
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:30,358
They hit him with an iron bar. Oh, no.

298
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,900
Then they stole a patrol boat.

299
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:37,962
We found it abandoned in the Arbor of Sarosh 6. Nice.

300
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,354
An hour ago.

301
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:41,354
Could you recognize these men again?

302
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:44,470
Yeah, I could make sketches of them.

303
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,820
What are you doing here?

304
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:54,542
You know these people? Lutheran? Of course I do.

305
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:56,436
This is my mother. And that man. Gentlemen.

306
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:58,490
Can identify the thieves. Who?

307
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,594
What is it?

308
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:02,472
They're no longer just thieves.

309
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:04,160
They're murderers.

310
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:06,140
Your man just died in the hospital.

311
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,480
Please start work on your drawings at once, Mr. Devon.

312
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,990
No.

313
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,230
I don't believe you.

314
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,470
Not one word.

315
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,304
You've taken the swastika, and you've invented

316
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:36,218
this fantastic story so that you can

317
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:37,800
keep all the money for yourselves.

318
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,520
I demand my share, and I want it now.

319
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,600
Look at that.

320
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,992
How do I know that these men who

321
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:56,000
stole the boat are not working with you? Mr.

322
00:22:56,001 --> 00:23:00,190
Schroeder, either you're a very good actor,

323
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:03,888
or you really are an innocent. Come on.

324
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:05,550
Who else knows?

325
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,948
I've already told you.

326
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:10,266
Only my wife.

327
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:12,052
And I only told her there was the U

328
00:23:12,053 --> 00:23:14,610
vault and that the swastika was in it.

329
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:17,380
I never told her where the wreck was.

330
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:18,960
They'll soon find out.

331
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,660
She told whoever she told.

332
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,320
No, it's not possible.

333
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,640
Helen, darling, these are the people.

334
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,830
And this is my wife.

335
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,668
She's ready. Please.

336
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:44,012
Thank you.

337
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:45,570
Good evening, Madam Shah.

338
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:46,550
Good evening.

339
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,230
Helen.

340
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:51,472
Tell them that you did not

341
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,670
talk about the jeweled swastika.

342
00:23:53,671 --> 00:23:55,408
I didn't say anything.

343
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:56,986
Your apartment was burgled.

344
00:23:56,987 --> 00:23:59,156
Your husband was beaten up today.

345
00:23:59,157 --> 00:24:00,250
A man was killed.

346
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:01,716
Are you blaming me? No.

347
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:04,756
We thought you might have inadvertently said something.

348
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:06,058
In a shop, in a taxi.

349
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,604
Not that you spelled it out for anyone,

350
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:09,422
but you could have dropped a hint.

351
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:10,728
I said nothing.

352
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:12,334
The cleaning woman.

353
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:13,832
We don't have one.

354
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,016
We can't afford it.

355
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:16,382
Me, I always talk to the dentist,

356
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:18,494
you know, kind of a defense mechanism.

357
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:21,170
Manicurist, hairdresser.

358
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,518
Guillaume. Helen.

359
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,914
What's about Guillaume?

360
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:28,060
Who's there?

361
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:29,794
Helen's hairdresser.

362
00:24:29,795 --> 00:24:32,038
She visits him every Wednesday.

363
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,020
Oh, no.

364
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,380
Yes.

365
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:43,008
One time I couldn't pay his account.

366
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:44,540
I asked him to wait.

367
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,050
He said, I'm sorry, Kurt.

368
00:24:49,051 --> 00:24:51,972
He said, you should have a husband who can

369
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:54,570
afford to give you the luxuries you deserve.

370
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:56,190
Oh, I was so furious.

371
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,334
What did you say to him?

372
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:03,222
I said, my husband could have

373
00:25:03,223 --> 00:25:05,090
a fortune if he wanted to.

374
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,560
Then he laughed and I said, what kind of a fortune?

375
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,602
I said it was there waiting for him.

376
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:22,226
If anytime he wanted it, he only

377
00:25:22,227 --> 00:25:24,424
had to pick up the telephone.

378
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:26,082
Where can we find this guy?

379
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:30,400
He lives over his shop, 23 Rue Morrow.

380
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:32,280
But I said nothing about jewels.

381
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,638
Nothing about you both. You didn't have to.

382
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:36,850
I think you said enough.

383
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,832
I'm so sorry, darling. Don't worry.

384
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:43,940
Please don't worry.

385
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,750
I'm sorry.

386
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,498
She's very highly strung. Nervous. Go on.

387
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:52,420
Australia.

388
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,104
Never trust a Dan that gets her hair fixed

389
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:05,842
once a week and can't pay for it. Come.

390
00:26:05,843 --> 00:26:07,650
Think we'd never trust one who can.

391
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,402
Open it.

392
00:26:29,403 --> 00:26:31,902
Police officers. Oh no.

393
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:33,080
You're a nod.

394
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,730
Watch the front, will you?

395
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,372
Mrs.

396
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:02,480
Schroeder would require a new hairdresser.

397
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,962
Impossible.

398
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:18,960
All of you.

399
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,980
If you'd only done what you should have.

400
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:24,648
If you'd rung me and told me to go

401
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:27,134
to that hairdressers, the man would still be alive.

402
00:27:27,135 --> 00:27:29,700
But he'd be dead sometime before we found him.

403
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,180
That is not the point.

404
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,410
We are very very sorry. George.

405
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:41,640
Please try to remember that this is no longer your war.

406
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,760
You are respectable middle aged people.

407
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,028
Well, middle aged anyway.

408
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:49,616
Please try to behave as such.

409
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:50,902
I don't feel middle aged.

410
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,192
I'm not sure I even look it.

411
00:27:52,193 --> 00:27:53,630
Yeah, don't worry.

412
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:56,550
Please just keep quiet.

413
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:57,930
Middle aged.

414
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,632
This gang obviously beat up Schroeder to

415
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:04,510
discover what his wife called his fortune.

416
00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:06,454
They then followed Schroeder when he came to Les

417
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:09,482
Paischur, guessed that you were helping him, and followed

418
00:28:09,483 --> 00:28:11,802
you when you went to rent the diving equipment.

419
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:13,880
We do know all. Course. Of course.

420
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:14,900
You know everything.

421
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,704
What you don't know is what

422
00:28:17,705 --> 00:28:19,670
is evident to everyone else.

423
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:23,670
That your life is in extreme danger. Really?

424
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:26,222
You and only you can identify

425
00:28:26,223 --> 00:28:27,794
those men on the custom boat.

426
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:29,788
Those sketches you made have been distributed to

427
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:32,770
every police station, every frontier guard in France.

428
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:34,652
Anyone looking remotely like them

429
00:28:34,653 --> 00:28:36,770
has been detained and searched.

430
00:28:36,771 --> 00:28:38,200
And we could find nothing.

431
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,284
So it's fairly obvious that those

432
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,580
men are still in Nice.

433
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,512
Therefore they'd like to bump me off.

434
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:46,048
Yes, and they will if you go

435
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:47,318
rushing around like you did tonight.

436
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,570
Like some wild crazy elephant.

437
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,400
Please, all of you, leave it to us.

438
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,760
Now if you'll be so kind,

439
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,474
I'd like to question the Schroeders.

440
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:03,812
Yes, George is right.

441
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:06,340
But he's got one thing figured out.

442
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,270
That hairdresser got himself killed by his own gang.

443
00:29:10,271 --> 00:29:11,940
Keep him from talking to us.

444
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,928
Sure, but who knew we were going to see him?

445
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:17,554
I mean, we didn't even know ourselves.

446
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:23,394
Just before we left here, Mrs.

447
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,844
Schroeder, she could have made a

448
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:28,360
phone call right after she.

449
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,798
So it seems that Mrs.

450
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,784
Schroeder's been one jump ahead of us all the time.

451
00:29:34,785 --> 00:29:37,648
So it seems she's the only one apart from

452
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:40,010
the four of us who could have known.

453
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,180
How did your horses run today?

454
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,930
Slower than the rest, madame.

455
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,158
You like to drain monsieur?

456
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,970
Big win, the end of the rainbow.

457
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,352
Echo. What?

458
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:08,076
Madame, I'd like to ask you a personal question.

459
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:09,270
Of course, madamE.

460
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,212
Are you short of cash? Who is not?

461
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:17,154
Madame, you pay me well, but the workies don't.

462
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:18,890
That is right, monsieur.

463
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:22,934
Last week I told Madame I won money, but it was a lie.

464
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:25,696
I lost 50. No, 55.

465
00:30:25,697 --> 00:30:28,368
55 what?

466
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:29,610
Francs, monsieur.

467
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,350
That's only five pounds.

468
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,400
$12.

469
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,880
We thought you meant 55,000.

470
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,218
To many my position, monsieur, 55 francs

471
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:43,316
is a great deal of money.

472
00:30:43,317 --> 00:30:45,310
Now, don't be offended, Ercule.

473
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,300
We thought.

474
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,090
What, madame?

475
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,158
Listen, you know about the brooch.

476
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,104
Naturally, monsieur. Okay.

477
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:59,164
Now, it seems that anything we try to do,

478
00:30:59,165 --> 00:31:02,252
somebody's always just one jump ahead of us.

479
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:04,170
You thought that I.

480
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:05,868
Madame Marget, did you think that

481
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:07,436
I would steal from you?

482
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:09,618
Nobody said that, Elkhil.

483
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:12,220
Madame Marget, I cannot work for you any longer.

484
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,970
I wish to give you my notice.

485
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,208
I know you're my employer, but I

486
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,140
thought also you were my friend.

487
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,750
I do not stay where I am not trusted.

488
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:26,340
Eku. Yeah.

489
00:31:26,341 --> 00:31:28,372
We were only asking you like we asked

490
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:30,400
each other before you came in, didn't we?

491
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,068
But it could have been any of the five of us, right?

492
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:35,348
But it wasn't right.

493
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:37,252
We're friends, we trust each other.

494
00:31:37,253 --> 00:31:37,780
That's the end of it.

495
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:39,214
Come on, silly, have a drink.

496
00:31:39,215 --> 00:31:40,180
There you go.

497
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,014
I'm sorry if I was too quick, madam.

498
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:48,310
I do not wish to leave, but to feel I was not trusted.

499
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,560
I should like to withdraw my notice, please.

500
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,290
I wouldn't know what to do without you, Elkir.

501
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,580
Good health, madame. Good health.

502
00:31:57,581 --> 00:32:01,356
Have you got any ideas, monsieur, about

503
00:32:01,357 --> 00:32:03,660
who's blowing the whistle on us? Oh, no.

504
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,580
Nor does anyone.

505
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,136
I guess we'll have to do it the long way round. My way?

506
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:09,648
What's that?

507
00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:12,176
Like I was saying, the police pull in everybody

508
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:15,318
in Nice who resembles those sketches I made lines

509
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:17,508
them up for me to identify, that's all.

510
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:19,188
But it'll take us the best part of a week.

511
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:20,052
But we'll find them.

512
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:21,402
Why you, monsieur?

513
00:32:21,403 --> 00:32:23,130
Well, he's the only one that can identify.

514
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:26,160
If it hadn't been for me, they'd have run out by this.

515
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,348
Know.

516
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:28,392
We'll find them all right.

517
00:32:28,393 --> 00:32:30,398
And they'll lead us to the rest of the gang.

518
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,528
That's right, isn't it?

519
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:34,168
Now, Hickey, all you have to do for me

520
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:36,574
is to line up three large whiskeys and sodas

521
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:37,996
at the end of every day's work. Right?

522
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,670
I shall see to it, monsieur.

523
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,070
Thank you for the wine, madame.

524
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,724
Thank all of you for not doubting me.

525
00:32:47,725 --> 00:33:01,700
Here's the first horses farmhouse outside.

526
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:02,378
Leon.

527
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:04,640
What was the name of the man?

528
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,482
Paul Villa.

529
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:10,160
Oh, yeah, but what a caperer that was.

530
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,612
Well, that was fun.

531
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:14,072
Because it worked. Yes.

532
00:33:14,073 --> 00:33:16,382
If it hadn't, you'd have been a dead man. Tommy.

533
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:19,650
I don't think I was killed, Tommy.

534
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,870
You still think it could be Erkel?

535
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:27,940
I don't know.

536
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,748
But somebody knows everything we're up to, and

537
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:32,076
it's just one way of finding out.

538
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:33,800
Well, if we do it, we're going to have to tell.

539
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,898
We'll need a certain amount of cooperation.

540
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:40,572
Tommy, the honor's a long time

541
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:42,834
ago, and you're not the youngest.

542
00:33:42,835 --> 00:33:43,984
Watch it.

543
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:48,060
If you're right, these men will try to kill you.

544
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,270
It.

545
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,020
Who is it?

546
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,360
They told me, Le Pesha, that you were here.

547
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,132
May I talk to you for a moment?

548
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:07,200
Yes, of course.

549
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:17,034
Oh, you're packing some things for Mrs.

550
00:36:17,035 --> 00:36:18,632
Devon at the hospital. Yes.

551
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:19,780
Won't you sit down?

552
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,460
I'm so sorry.

553
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:29,612
You think it's my fault, don't you? Should?

554
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:30,680
I think so.

555
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,778
I told Guillaume I persuaded Kurt

556
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:37,410
to go after the Roach.

557
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:39,462
I'm sure you had your reasons.

558
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,620
Kurt is a good man, but not very strong.

559
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,500
I'm not very strong either.

560
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:50,480
Maybe I thought two weak people together would.

561
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,012
You don't know what it's like

562
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:57,530
to be lonely and disappointed.

563
00:36:57,531 --> 00:37:01,514
No, I know about loneliness

564
00:37:01,515 --> 00:37:04,450
and what you call disappointment.

565
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,810
I just don't care for it as an excuse.

566
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,132
I came here to see if there

567
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,510
was something I could do for Mr. Devon.

568
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,032
No, it's too late now.

569
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:20,980
For anybody to do anything.

570
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,570
When he comes out of the hospital, he must not risk.

571
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,920
Nothing is worth risking life.

572
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:34,012
I don't think he would agree with you.

573
00:37:34,013 --> 00:37:36,236
Neither would. Oh.

574
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:37,772
You must talk to him.

575
00:37:37,773 --> 00:37:39,080
Persuade him.

576
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,800
Tell him he must forget he ever saw those terrible men.

577
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,970
Tommy has a marvellous memory.

578
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:50,650
During the war, he was called the Elephant.

579
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:52,840
He never forgets anything.

580
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,350
Telephone, Doctor.

581
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,110
Your name, please.

582
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:10,710
He's all right.

583
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:12,414
How is he, monsieur?

584
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,624
Not good.

585
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,942
It's terrible.

586
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:16,248
Yeah, it is.

587
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:18,328
Monsieur Halliday, would it be possible

588
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:19,480
for me to go and see?

589
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:21,930
Nah, he's barely conscious.

590
00:38:21,931 --> 00:38:22,988
Well, it's all right.

591
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:25,932
He's just as good a friend of Tommy's as anybody. Go on.

592
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:27,590
Thank you, Mr. Halliday.

593
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,910
Go on. Echo.

594
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,378
Mrs.

595
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:19,920
Schroeder wants to see him.

596
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,978
He's really too old to see anyone. Mrs.

597
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:29,630
Schroeder, I'm sorry. May I just. Helen.

598
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,390
I feel so responsible.

599
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,690
Please give him these.

600
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,810
Thank you.

601
00:40:22,900 --> 00:41:13,208
Wouldn't take any pets back.

602
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:15,220
Do you have the money to pay for it?

603
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:21,350
Gideon, Louis Blanc, always back.

604
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:24,552
I want to see Madame Roger. She's not here.

605
00:41:24,553 --> 00:41:25,772
Then get her.

606
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:27,480
I have information.

607
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,960
Valuable information.

608
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,310
I am Madame Roger.

609
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:37,990
Madame.

610
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,838
I read the papers.

611
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:44,112
I see.

612
00:41:44,113 --> 00:41:45,846
My name is LeBron.

613
00:41:45,847 --> 00:41:48,534
I'm a fisherman.

614
00:41:48,535 --> 00:41:50,384
Yes, something like that.

615
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:52,090
Skull speaker.

616
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,480
My story there.

617
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,722
No one who reads the papers

618
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:06,244
these days can remain so better.

619
00:42:06,245 --> 00:42:07,940
You said you had some information.

620
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,020
All right.

621
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,970
A rum for Monsieur LeBron.

622
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:17,990
Cognac.

623
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,236
Okay.

624
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,190
Cognac.

625
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:24,950
My dad.

626
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:35,622
I read of the U board, swastika, and the customs

627
00:42:35,623 --> 00:42:42,378
men who had no customs men, and I laughed.

628
00:42:42,379 --> 00:42:47,524
Greedy people get what they deserve. It's better.

629
00:42:47,525 --> 00:43:04,078
It's better to be poor and content, like me is LeBron.

630
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,688
Yeah, I know. You said that.

631
00:43:05,689 --> 00:43:07,212
You got any more to say?

632
00:43:07,213 --> 00:43:08,268
Just say it.

633
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:12,690
Are you one of those who found the swastiko brochure?

634
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:14,898
Yes. Then you're out. Fool.

635
00:43:14,899 --> 00:43:16,924
Let me throw him. Wait. Wait.

636
00:43:16,925 --> 00:43:18,890
And so is Monsieur Devon.

637
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,960
But when I read in the papers what happened

638
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:26,400
to him, I must tell all I know.

639
00:43:26,401 --> 00:43:27,610
Another rum.

640
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,438
I know, madam.

641
00:43:38,439 --> 00:43:41,652
All those men were in the customs board.

642
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:45,390
I saw them, and I know their names.

643
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,326
It is same men who attack Monsieur Devon.

644
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,620
And I know where they are now.

645
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,420
How do you know where?

646
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,250
I was fishing.

647
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:03,458
I tie up my little boat in the arbor at Sunroy.

648
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:04,674
Should you do a drink?

649
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:08,438
To drink a little wine and the custom boat.

650
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:09,814
You come along anymore?

651
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:11,158
Next to mine.

652
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:13,446
I see them changing their clothes.

653
00:44:13,447 --> 00:44:14,860
I hear them talking.

654
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:17,470
I know their names.

655
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:19,936
And I know where they are

656
00:44:19,937 --> 00:44:23,366
going to ride to Swastika Bros.

657
00:44:23,367 --> 00:44:24,518
Saint Osh.

658
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:26,250
That's where they abounded the boat.

659
00:44:26,251 --> 00:44:27,360
Okay, then.

660
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,812
Did they see? No. No.

661
00:44:31,813 --> 00:44:33,490
I was in the cabin.

662
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:36,312
All right. Who are they?

663
00:44:36,313 --> 00:44:37,540
And where are they now?

664
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,280
Yes, it is very.

665
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:41,966
Of course, very valuable.

666
00:44:41,967 --> 00:44:44,690
Valuable information, monsieur. Valuable.

667
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:52,008
Possibly 1000 francs. You.

668
00:44:52,009 --> 00:44:54,150
Craft Hill, Laos.

669
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:55,880
Call the police. Air cool.

670
00:44:55,881 --> 00:44:58,890
No, I'll call them police.

671
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,544
Because you're going to tell the police what you know.

672
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:04,246
And not for a thousand francs.

673
00:45:04,247 --> 00:45:07,296
For nothing, Gratis. How cool.

674
00:45:07,297 --> 00:45:08,780
Take him in a back room.

675
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:11,908
I got a sergeant to give you

676
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,360
a free bath while you're there.

677
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:23,672
Up there, Alec. That's cool.

678
00:45:23,673 --> 00:45:25,270
Look around the docks.

679
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:26,180
All right.

680
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,850
It's.

681
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:46,860
Where is he?

682
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:50,272
He's over there by the boat. Come on.

683
00:46:50,273 --> 00:46:52,080
You're coming with us. Why?

684
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,464
Because I don't trust you.

685
00:46:58,465 --> 00:46:59,536
I must have the money.

686
00:46:59,537 --> 00:47:01,392
Now, move. I need it.

687
00:47:01,393 --> 00:47:02,896
50,000 francs this week.

688
00:47:02,897 --> 00:47:05,360
You'll get it when we sell the road.

689
00:47:05,361 --> 00:47:06,468
Where have you hidden it?

690
00:47:06,469 --> 00:47:08,404
To the safest place I know.

691
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:09,630
My pocket.

692
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,090
It.

693
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:46,356
It's.

694
00:48:46,357 --> 00:49:11,040
It's.

695
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,880
Well done, Manush. That ought to go. My lips.

696
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,560
George is always so punctual.

697
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,606
That was fun.

698
00:49:47,607 --> 00:49:48,850
I could tell you.

699
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,570
Noel Cool.

700
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:00,560
You realize he could spend his entire life in prison?

701
00:50:00,561 --> 00:50:01,546
Well, sure.

702
00:50:01,547 --> 00:50:04,570
He tried to have Tommy killed, didn't he? I know.

703
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,410
And the customs man was killed. I know.

704
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,110
Never mind.

705
00:50:10,111 --> 00:50:13,100
He made a lovely lot of bread for the hospital.

706
00:50:13,101 --> 00:50:14,780
I'm so glad.

707
00:50:14,781 --> 00:50:16,810
Haven't got a worry in the world.

708
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,960
And I'm so happy that you're alive.

709
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,730
Welcome.
