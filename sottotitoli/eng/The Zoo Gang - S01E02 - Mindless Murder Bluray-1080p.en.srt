1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,090
Madman must be on the loose.

2
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:14,122
Killing Anne for a piece of embroidery couldn't fail.

3
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:15,092
You get to pick the time.

4
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:16,750
The place have got the edge.

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,910
Fake.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,180
It's not possible.

7
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:28,650
It's possible.

8
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:29,800
Oh, absolutely.

9
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,360
Steve. Oh, John.

10
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:52,724
Do you know, I've been here seven years and

11
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,282
I still can't get used to the sunshine.

12
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:55,204
Well, if you miss the rain, you

13
00:04:55,205 --> 00:04:56,510
can always go back to London.

14
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,838
Where's Alec?

15
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,368
He'll be here.

16
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:12,420
What's up?

17
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,368
Well, you read the papers, haven't you? Yeah.

18
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:17,592
The maid of the consulate. Ann.

19
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:18,664
I knew her.

20
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:20,574
I want us to find the killer.

21
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:21,596
It's not our job.

22
00:05:21,597 --> 00:05:23,410
The madman must be on the loose.

23
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:26,082
Killing Anne for a piece of embroidery.

24
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,330
The girl in Tulon.

25
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,036
One cheap earring was taken.

26
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,578
And the first girl in Antib.

27
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,948
I know. Alec. Hi. Good morning. Morning.

28
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,370
Hello, Alec.

29
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:38,150
Now, what do you. Huh?

30
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,268
Should we find the murderer of the consular maid? Sure.

31
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:45,002
Where do we start? We don't.

32
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:46,852
The police are going to do that.

33
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:48,276
Three girls, all young.

34
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:50,964
No enemies, no money, no reason for it to happen.

35
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:53,172
Do we just sit by? Yes.

36
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,300
We're not in this for cakes. You agreed to that.

37
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,826
Well, what's the matter with cakes?

38
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:59,508
I mean, we brought the Zoo gang alive again after

39
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:01,806
28 years so as we could come alive ourselves.

40
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:04,824
And what have we been doing sitting around for weeks?

41
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:07,054
Well, I'm sorry if you're bored, but that's

42
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:08,718
not reason enough to do something that doesn't

43
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:09,912
fit in with the plans we made.

44
00:06:09,913 --> 00:06:12,600
There was a million reasons for not doing anything.

45
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,540
That's the only reason for the Zoo gang right there.

46
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,732
Raise money for the hospital. Right.

47
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:20,018
Very true, Steve.

48
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,202
Unarguable.

49
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:22,550
So I won't argue.

50
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,128
I just suggest we do it manous once. Why?

51
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:28,480
Well, we made the rules in the old days.

52
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:30,112
I mean, we can break them.

53
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:31,104
I think we'd all like to

54
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:32,950
find the killers of those girls.

55
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:35,668
And if we need a justification of

56
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,044
some sorts, there is a reward. Yeah.

57
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,116
Thousand dollars.

58
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:41,626
That might buy bedpans.

59
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:42,842
If you ever get the hospital

60
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:44,880
built, bedpans will be needed.

61
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,616
Look, Steve, all we're doing at the moment

62
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,230
is sitting around doing nothing, getting rusty.

63
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:54,046
We made plans in the old days, but we weren't rigid.

64
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,440
We improvised, you know, did what we

65
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:58,260
felt was best at the time.

66
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,370
Okay, Manous.

67
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,898
You go and talk to the parents

68
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,470
of the girl that was killed.

69
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,322
You go up to Tulan.

70
00:07:06,323 --> 00:07:08,680
See what you can find out about the girl up there.

71
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,008
And you go and dig up all

72
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:12,352
you can about that police car.

73
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:14,540
It had to come from someplace. Right.

74
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,890
And I'll go to Anchi.

75
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,400
Alex suddenly looks ten years younger, don't I? Five.

76
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,150
How's yours?

77
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,770
My son carries the entire weight of the police department,

78
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:37,358
if not of the whole world, on his shoulders.

79
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,472
Time to open.

80
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:39,460
Bye, love.

81
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,550
Steve.

82
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,082
Anything? Nope.

83
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,356
Dead end for the three of us.

84
00:07:53,357 --> 00:07:55,480
Did you get to too long? Yeah.

85
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,836
I picked up something the police have just heard.

86
00:07:59,837 --> 00:08:02,768
I don't know how that extortion was the

87
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:05,830
motive for the killing of those girls.

88
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:06,810
Extortion?

89
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,210
What do you extort from? People haven't.

90
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,950
There's something else that might just be connected.

91
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,642
Eight good sized emeralds are being fenced.

92
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:20,052
Word is they were cut from that big

93
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:23,120
stone Baron housely bought his wife last year.

94
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,490
You talked to the couldn't.

95
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:28,600
He left his villa in too long.

96
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:30,206
Two days after the second murder.

97
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,700
Word is he's traveling around the world. Coffee? Yeah.

98
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,015
Well, we haven't heard anything

99
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,850
about an emerald being stolen.

100
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,227
But it's gone and it's cut up.

101
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:42,988
And the baron hasn't said a word.

102
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,284
Why, you think.

103
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:46,650
Well, let's assume extortion.

104
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,030
But how does that tie in with the killings?

105
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,008
Well, an extortionist doesn't just walk up to you

106
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:56,300
and say, how about giving me your emerald, sir?

107
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,064
But what if they sent him one of

108
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:04,592
the dead girl's earrings, for instance, and then

109
00:09:04,593 --> 00:09:06,518
came back and asked for the emerald?

110
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,692
He'd give it to him, wouldn't he?

111
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:11,460
Then take off before they decided to ask for more.

112
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:12,244
That's right.

113
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:13,668
He's too scared to talk, and

114
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:15,066
the killings can't be traced.

115
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:16,560
And they got it made.

116
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,190
Hello, Mr. Halliday.

117
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,952
You did say you wanted the day off.

118
00:09:26,953 --> 00:09:30,318
That was before my date walked out on me. George.

119
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,370
He says he's stuck with extra duty.

120
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,618
He's forced to Gardalyn.

121
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,324
Martin, wait.

122
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,074
You can't worry about her, surely.

123
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:38,706
She's nearly old enough to be his mother.

124
00:09:38,707 --> 00:09:40,620
The Martins are Hollywood's gift to love.

125
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,924
They made a career out of adoring each other.

126
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:44,390
Well, I'm not jealous.

127
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:46,758
But with thousands of actresses in town for the film

128
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:50,054
festival, why did George get stuck with that man eater?

129
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:51,648
Now, that's an interesting question.

130
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:53,232
Police lieutenants don't usually get

131
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:54,340
guard duty, do they?

132
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:57,070
He did say something about a possible robbery.

133
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,202
Didn't Martin buy his wife the Kimberly

134
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:02,836
Star Diamond a couple of weeks ago? He did.

135
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:04,532
I read about that.

136
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:06,366
Nice target for thieves.

137
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,318
I think it's very inconsiderate of thieves

138
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:10,200
to plan things on my day off.

139
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:11,940
I'll be out front if you want me.

140
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,616
Or not.

141
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:18,340
Thieves, extortionists. Yeah.

142
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,338
George could be guarding Lynn

143
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:25,530
Martin because of their threats.

144
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:27,850
Now, I'll give you ODs on that.

145
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:29,378
And Martin called the police.

146
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,468
And they tipped off the police in too long.

147
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:33,362
Well, that's logical, provided Martin

148
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:34,710
did call the cops.

149
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,432
None of the other victims did.

150
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:37,702
Well, he's not your plain,

151
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,760
ordinary, everyday victim, is he?

152
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:41,792
You tell the average guy you're going to kill

153
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:43,616
his wife if he doesn't hand over the family

154
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:45,792
jewels and he doesn't think twice about it.

155
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:47,658
But Martin's been in so many movies

156
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,482
where he's the hero whipping the enemy

157
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,600
single handed, he thinks he's for real.

158
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,188
I think we should look in on this.

159
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,910
Celluloid Superman.

160
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,630
I want to speak to Mr. Martin.

161
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:01,112
He isn't seeing anyone.

162
00:11:01,113 --> 00:11:02,870
My name's Devon.

163
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,984
He's bought some jewellery from me in the past.

164
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:06,504
I've got some with me.

165
00:11:06,505 --> 00:11:08,200
I think he'd like to see me.

166
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,720
You have to take him a message.

167
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,430
Yes, monsieur.

168
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,050
Thing from my mind.

169
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,900
Sunday.

170
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,924
How's your mother?

171
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:18,736
You just sent a message to Martin?

172
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,320
Yes, Sajon.

173
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:21,750
You can go back to your place.

174
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,754
Come with me.

175
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:24,680
Delighted.

176
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,484
I got their message, madam.

177
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:36,920
Might as well tell you that I don't pay extortion

178
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,220
and I shall never give up for Kimberly Starr.

179
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,670
Does your wife agree?

180
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,274
Lynn knows nothing about this, and

181
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:47,826
I don't propose to worry her.

182
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:50,242
She's in no danger with the police here. Mr.

183
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:53,400
Martin, you're the one lead to the killers.

184
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:55,158
I'm only asking you to let us

185
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,380
know of any contact they make.

186
00:12:57,381 --> 00:12:58,774
Can you tell me one reason why I

187
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,438
should bother with a jeweler when the whole

188
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:02,346
police department's working on this case?

189
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:06,874
Yes, I have connections that the Police don't have.

190
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,138
I also have information that they don't know about.

191
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:10,790
What?

192
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,512
In Tulum, a large emerald

193
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:18,366
was extorted from Baron Heisliff. Right? We know this.

194
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,254
Yes, well, you may not know that the

195
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,044
emerald was cut into eight smaller stones.

196
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:25,428
All right, so they got an emerald.

197
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,504
They'll get nothing from me. Lynn is safe.

198
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:30,270
You've seen all the police around here.

199
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,600
She is safe.

200
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:37,120
No one can be absolutely certain,

201
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,336
but we've taken all possible precautions.

202
00:13:39,337 --> 00:13:40,770
That's not good enough.

203
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,950
What do you think?

204
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:44,960
I think there is some danger.

205
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,068
The girl with the embroidery was the third victim.

206
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:51,132
We've got to stop these killers.

207
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,438
This is the first chance we've had

208
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:54,660
to trap them with Linna's bait.

209
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,674
What if one of the gang gets away?

210
00:13:57,675 --> 00:13:59,104
What if he wants revenge?

211
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,590
Next week, next month, next year,

212
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,360
I can have the bloody diamond.

213
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:08,244
Of course I'll abide by your decision.

214
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:09,758
Lynn got along all right before she

215
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,820
ever heard of the Kimberly Star.

216
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:13,454
She can get along without it now.

217
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:15,198
What are you talking about?

218
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,756
Absolutely nothing, my sweet.

219
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:18,094
What is going on here?

220
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:20,990
I can't go to the dawn without tripping over a cop.

221
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:22,904
I found one in the broom closet.

222
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,416
I think he tried to look like a vacuum cleaner.

223
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:26,552
Routine protection.

224
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:27,528
You know, the sort of trash

225
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:28,952
that's attracted to a film festival.

226
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,360
Don't hand me that bull.

227
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,450
I just heard you say you'd give away my star.

228
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,142
Wherever did you get that idea?

229
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,318
It's that skinny Greek broad who's going

230
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:40,508
to be in your next picture.

231
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,550
I've seen how you look at her.

232
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:43,932
Well, give her $10.

233
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,306
It's more than she's worth.

234
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:47,248
That's unkind to a very nice lady.

235
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,480
And beneath your dignity.

236
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:52,122
If you're in charge of these cops, I don't know

237
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:54,778
what they're here for, but get them out fast.

238
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:55,994
Who are you?

239
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,904
Secretary of the local branch of the Lin.

240
00:14:57,905 --> 00:14:59,560
Martin Fangla, madam.

241
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,182
I'm sorry, Tony, but you'll have to tell

242
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:05,172
the Greek she is out of luck.

243
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:07,636
The stars in the safe in my bedroom.

244
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:09,688
And I have the combination changed.

245
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,550
I'm the only one who knows it.

246
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,042
Lynn, the people that sent me this

247
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:19,340
note have already committed three murders.

248
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,738
I'm sorry, darling. I should have known.

249
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:34,450
You have better tastes than to go for the Greek.

250
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:36,320
It wasn't nice of me.

251
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,944
So if you'll give me the star.

252
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:44,302
No chance, you silly cow.

253
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:45,518
These men are monsters.

254
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,310
They'd kill you as an object lesson.

255
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:50,558
I have been getting crackpot threats.

256
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,102
Since I made my first picture when I was 16.

257
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:54,802
I mean, twelve. All right, January.

258
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:56,092
You can keep your army on hand.

259
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:58,200
But tell them to stay out of my way.

260
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,670
The fans will see me at the festival tomorrow.

261
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,100
And I will be wearing the star.

262
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,608
Why don't you get rid of

263
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:15,390
that lousy mirror, you silly cow?

264
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:25,150
She's marvelous, absolutely marvelous.

265
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,450
It was a really remarkable performance.

266
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,438
She refuses to give up the Darren.

267
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,288
Regally dismissing any idea that

268
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:38,622
she might be in danger.

269
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,286
She's quite a character.

270
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:41,582
She's going to get herself killed.

271
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,560
Mour Georges is there to protect her.

272
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,284
Can't we help him in any way?

273
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,066
She's got enough bodyguards.

274
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:49,340
Anyway, it isn't our job.

275
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,154
You mean you're not concerned about Lyn

276
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:53,980
Martin getting killed like the other? Sure. Hold it.

277
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,582
I really am concerned about Lynn Martin.

278
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,048
If we don't help her.

279
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,214
What's more, I'm concerned about George.

280
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:03,526
Yes, I'm concerned.

281
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:05,248
Well, there's no use putting guards on her.

282
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:07,828
Anyway, as long as the killers are calling me

283
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,412
shots, they get to pick the time, the place.

284
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:11,010
They've got the edge.

285
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:12,602
Guards can't do anything but react.

286
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:14,609
They usually do that too late.

287
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,571
So the fox has an idea.

288
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:20,260
What we should do is get them to play the game our way.

289
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,260
How? How?

290
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:25,619
We show him that there's no advantage in killing her.

291
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,916
If she doesn't have the diamond, she can't deliver it.

292
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:32,018
We might get a lead on the killer.

293
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:35,218
I'll see you in Omni Mountain villa tonight.

294
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:36,242
No, not tonight.

295
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:37,430
In broad daylight.

296
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,390
In the garage, quietly.

297
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,122
Careful. Manous.

298
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:34,310
Who would notice one more among an army of servants?

299
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:56,164
George woods here.

300
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:58,958
I have the laundry for the delivery.

301
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,290
Out of the van.

302
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,090
Be careful.

303
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,100
Lean against there.

304
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,130
No funny moods.

305
00:20:09,131 --> 00:20:10,956
Something wrong with me?

306
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:12,310
Open the back doors.

307
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,610
You have a law against the laundry?

308
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,852
Laundry man, you're getting later every day.

309
00:20:32,853 --> 00:20:35,140
We've been waiting for these sheets all morning.

310
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:38,180
If the law will allow, I will bring them.

311
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,220
Wait.

312
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,800
I want two more Men stationed over there.

313
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,394
That makes a total of four at each gate.

314
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,040
And report back to me as soon as it's being done.

315
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,480
All right.

316
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,120
You, please.

317
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,670
George.

318
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,364
George, I have a word with you.

319
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:36,120
Supporting authority that the Kimberley Star

320
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:38,408
is currently for sale to anyone.

321
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:41,150
And I quote, with the proper connections

322
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:43,100
and a reasonable amount of money.

323
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,754
Someone must be very confident he'll

324
00:21:44,755 --> 00:21:45,964
get his hands on it.

325
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:50,444
My impression is that someone already has. What?

326
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:52,716
First, I'm to be murdered, now I'm supposed

327
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:54,258
to have been robbed of a diamond.

328
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:56,690
I know positively. It's in my safe. My angel.

329
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,368
If you don't stop complaining, I personally will

330
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:00,070
see to the murder part of your statement.

331
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:03,328
I'm beginning to think you rigged this whole lousy act.

332
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:06,560
You'd lap up the publicity and get the diamond too.

333
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,332
All right.

334
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,230
We'll go through with this charade.

335
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,378
Oh, Tony.

336
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,212
You to the other side of the room with

337
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,490
your back turn whilst I work the combination.

338
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,104
Who gave you the diamond in the first place?

339
00:22:26,105 --> 00:22:27,352
You did.

340
00:22:27,353 --> 00:22:29,928
However, it's mine now and you're not

341
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:31,912
going to get your hands on it.

342
00:22:31,913 --> 00:22:33,560
I know what you're like.

343
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,252
You make promises, but you're just liable to get

344
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:38,588
loaded and hand it to some little tramp if

345
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:40,876
I give you half the chance, which I want.

346
00:22:40,877 --> 00:22:42,982
I've already given it to a little tramp.

347
00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:46,330
All right, sports fans, on your toes.

348
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,860
I'm terribly sorry.

349
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:57,108
On the other hand, of course, I

350
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,950
am delighted to know that it's safe.

351
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,164
You think I don't know what you

352
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:06,400
had in mind, you pinheaded wonder.

353
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,032
Being capable of having something in mind already

354
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:10,664
puts me way beyond your reach, my love.

355
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:12,952
You just wanted to get your hands on it.

356
00:23:12,953 --> 00:23:15,598
It goes right back into the safe. And it stays.

357
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:31,300
There's my love.

358
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:32,948
In the past, I've been known to compare your

359
00:23:32,949 --> 00:23:35,498
disposition to that of a rhinoceros with stomach cramps.

360
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:38,228
But I freely extend my fullest apologies to all.

361
00:23:38,229 --> 00:24:10,390
Rhinocero combination turns to the righteous.

362
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,954
You impossible double.

363
00:24:39,955 --> 00:24:41,074
Die, cheating.

364
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:43,746
Lousy LAughs Tony.

365
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:45,858
Come here, you dirty pig.

366
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,156
I don't know how you did it, but

367
00:24:48,157 --> 00:24:50,636
give back my star, I'll murder you.

368
00:24:50,637 --> 00:24:53,910
Did you think I'd believe in this fake robbery?

369
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,130
It's fake.

370
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,770
This burglary is a Lie.

371
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,388
It's unbelievable. I don't like it.

372
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:07,956
There is something not quite right.

373
00:25:07,957 --> 00:25:10,058
The place was crawling with police.

374
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:12,030
Even we would have thought twice.

375
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,428
There's only one man might have possibly tried.

376
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:16,370
Rebel.

377
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,446
He's in prison.

378
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:20,478
So there was no burglary.

379
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,462
The story was released with the cooperation

380
00:25:22,463 --> 00:25:24,340
of the police to put us off.

381
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,360
Get in touch with Martin.

382
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,990
12 hours from now.

383
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:40,410
840 in the morning.

384
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,440
Tell him to wait into fumble wits the diamond.

385
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,616
If you go in for a million dollar dimes.

386
00:25:56,617 --> 00:25:57,660
Kind of cute.

387
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,850
It's just a tiny bit ostentatious. Do you think?

388
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,210
I never really developed a taste for these.

389
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,794
Not the sort of thing my family went in for. Really?

390
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:17,056
I didn't know you had a deprived childhood.

391
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:18,150
Oh, absolutely.

392
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,192
We didn't even have half a million dollar German.

393
00:26:22,193 --> 00:26:23,498
I was a boy.

394
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,500
Pitiful.

395
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,864
That lady's got a strong neck.

396
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:30,638
The diamond wouldn't have stayed that size long

397
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:32,462
if those extortionists got hold of it.

398
00:26:32,463 --> 00:26:35,444
They'd have cut it up too recognizable.

399
00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:38,220
Still bring a nice hunk of cash, wouldn't it?

400
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,190
Diamonds are the thief's best friend.

401
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,328
Easily concealed.

402
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:44,946
Just as negotiable. Yeah.

403
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:45,950
Suits you.

404
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,470
Martin has until tomorrow morning

405
00:26:58,471 --> 00:27:00,422
to deliver the Kimberly Star.

406
00:27:00,423 --> 00:27:05,402
George told me stealing that bobble hasn't given

407
00:27:05,403 --> 00:27:06,794
us a lot of time, has it?

408
00:27:06,795 --> 00:27:08,026
And no lead.

409
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,418
Hey, where would you go if you

410
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,270
wanted to get this thing caught up?

411
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,254
Well, there's only one man in the world

412
00:27:16,255 --> 00:27:20,220
with the requisite skill and reliable dishonesty.

413
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,788
And that man is Philippe.

414
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:24,180
Avenue de Valer.

415
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:26,520
Come promote home industry.

416
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,550
Smuggling a piece of ice that size out of the

417
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:32,280
country for cutting would be a totally unnecessary risk.

418
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:33,760
Elbow.

419
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:35,378
And what if he was convinced that

420
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:37,544
Lyn Martin doesn't have the diamond?

421
00:27:37,545 --> 00:27:39,340
He'd pass on the word, wouldn't?

422
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,660
Hmm.

423
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,526
Yeah, I'll drop in on him. No, not you.

424
00:27:45,527 --> 00:27:46,610
Not me either.

425
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,828
Oh, no, Tommy.

426
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:53,926
Now this gang is very comfortable dealing with women.

427
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:55,398
Killing them, you mean.

428
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:58,570
Look, Georges was the officer in charge, right?

429
00:27:58,571 --> 00:28:01,088
He had every opportunity to steal the diamond.

430
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:04,634
Now, if he stole it, who would he trust to sell it for?

431
00:28:04,635 --> 00:28:05,514
Out of the question.

432
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:06,720
What do I do, Steven?

433
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:08,112
Now, listen, Steve.

434
00:28:08,113 --> 00:28:09,998
Her connection with George would only

435
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,156
make them suspect a trap.

436
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:12,692
They'd think the police is on her trail.

437
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:14,090
Kill minus and get out.

438
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,772
What we used to call calculated risk.

439
00:28:16,773 --> 00:28:18,116
What's your alternative?

440
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:20,834
The murder of Lynn Martin and the killing of

441
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:22,754
a number of women in the near future.

442
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:25,266
A stone which fitted in this

443
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:28,072
mounting must have been most impressive.

444
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,860
We both know that you recognize that mounting.

445
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,178
Let's hope we don't know.

446
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,236
If it were certain that I could identify

447
00:28:36,237 --> 00:28:39,158
that stone, I might be obliged, as a

448
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:43,978
law abiding citizen, to contact the authorities. Do.

449
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:46,360
My son would welcome a call.

450
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:48,458
I read that little Roger was in

451
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:52,180
charge of investigating this regrettable burglary.

452
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,496
Remarkable.

453
00:28:54,497 --> 00:28:56,868
Martin paid a million and a quarter

454
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,720
for this recent gift to his wife.

455
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,718
An actor pays more for an ornament than

456
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:05,988
a police lieutenant earns in a lifetime.

457
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:08,460
I sometimes wonder about our priorities.

458
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,786
Cut into small pieces, this

459
00:29:12,787 --> 00:29:16,882
might be worth about 500,000.

460
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:18,670
I suppose that it would.

461
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,950
You may know someone would be interested

462
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:27,286
in a large jewel for 200,000.

463
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:29,090
No one comes to mind.

464
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,264
I'd like to avoid difficulties.

465
00:29:35,265 --> 00:29:36,630
Wouldn't we all?

466
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,026
I'll be in my bar tomorrow morning, 07:00 I

467
00:29:42,027 --> 00:29:46,010
don't awaken that early, not even for money.

468
00:29:47,340 --> 00:30:08,860
Madame's mother has disar.

469
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:10,646
She wants 200,000.

470
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:11,890
It's not possible.

471
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,990
Police Lieutenant is the only one

472
00:30:15,991 --> 00:30:18,054
who could possibly have taken.

473
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:20,770
Of course, as you say.

474
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,940
Now, is he on the take or is he setting a trap?

475
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,136
It would be safer to assume a trap.

476
00:30:31,137 --> 00:30:33,792
And yet only a crooked, frightened

477
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:35,406
policeman would sell at that price.

478
00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:36,940
It's a bargain.

479
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:38,500
Trap needs convincing.

480
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:42,810
Vade, the policeman offers his mother's life.

481
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,880
It's too convincing.

482
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,288
Trap or no trap, can we permit

483
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:51,234
a woman to take it from us?

484
00:30:51,235 --> 00:30:55,360
She asks us to buy back our diamond. Ours?

485
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:56,770
It belongs to us.

486
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,746
We planned it.

487
00:30:57,747 --> 00:30:59,300
We made it work.

488
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:00,678
You planned it, John.

489
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:02,102
It was beautiful.

490
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:03,600
It couldn't fail.

491
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,290
It won't fail.

492
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,830
Well, George. Come in. Come in.

493
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:34,528
Something very important bring you here

494
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,460
this hour of the night? Yes.

495
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,230
I've been to my mother's house and Mr. Devons.

496
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,680
Both of them are out.

497
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:47,498
I've memorized, studied, analyzed all the exploits

498
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:49,220
of the Zoo gang during the war.

499
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:51,322
THose stories were all I had of my father.

500
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:53,410
You've inherited some of his qualities.

501
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,072
A good police officer learns to pick up

502
00:31:58,073 --> 00:32:02,020
a scent when there isn't one, feel something.

503
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,240
Recognize a pattern that doesn't exist now.

504
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,280
The theft of the Kimberley Star.

505
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,780
If it had been done 30 years ago, it could.

506
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:16,178
No, it would have been the work of the Zoo gang.

507
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:17,792
It isn't 30 years ago.

508
00:32:17,793 --> 00:32:19,862
I don't have a whisper of evidence.

509
00:32:19,863 --> 00:32:26,350
But tell me you're not involved at all.

510
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:27,488
Oh, I guess you could say

511
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:28,912
we were thieves during the war.

512
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,068
But then we were stealing for

513
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:32,720
the Resistance, not for ourselves. I know.

514
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,892
Well, do you think any of us would steal now?

515
00:32:35,893 --> 00:32:36,990
Your mother?

516
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,440
You're evading the point.

517
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,900
Tell me the truth.

518
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,150
You just answered your own question.

519
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,938
If you're going to assume we're common thieves, then

520
00:32:52,939 --> 00:32:55,110
we wouldn't draw the line at lying, would we?

521
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,220
It.

522
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,950
It.

523
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,262
Look, do you mind?

524
00:33:54,263 --> 00:33:55,330
I'm trying to study.

525
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,742
Do you have to do that now?

526
00:34:00,743 --> 00:34:02,300
Touch me and I scream.

527
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,650
I know your type.

528
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,606
You're mad.

529
00:34:10,607 --> 00:34:12,007
I've always known it.

530
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,326
I'm disguised.

531
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:15,239
Oh, as what?

532
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,580
And for what?

533
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:22,717
Don't pretend you recognize me, you everlasting laugh.

534
00:34:22,718 --> 00:34:25,038
Anyway, I'm off to the hairdresser.

535
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:27,186
And without that idiot escort.

536
00:34:27,187 --> 00:34:28,322
What about Francois?

537
00:34:28,323 --> 00:34:29,538
He comes here to do your hair.

538
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:30,972
Poor darling was hit by a car.

539
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:33,190
His brother just phoned me from the hospital.

540
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,060
I'm not letting you leave the house.

541
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,967
My dear husband, if you think for one moment that

542
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:42,351
I'm going to go to that reception tonight without having

543
00:34:42,352 --> 00:34:45,504
my hair done, you're even sillier than you look.

544
00:34:45,505 --> 00:34:47,748
Francois'brother was sweet enough to squeeze me.

545
00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:51,737
An appointment at Madame Cliche and beauty Pala.

546
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:53,434
Appointments at festivals are harder

547
00:34:53,435 --> 00:34:55,550
to get than husbands.

548
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,980
Besides, no one will recognise me anyway.

549
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:00,250
Not in this disguise.

550
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:01,832
It's out of the question.

551
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,416
How would you get there anyway?

552
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,054
In the Rolls.

553
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:08,110
But I'm going to ride up in front with the driver.

554
00:35:08,111 --> 00:35:10,110
Lynn, don't be so foolish.

555
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:11,550
Ta da da.

556
00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:13,620
Look, it's absolutely crazy.

557
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,774
Lynn.

558
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:21,070
Look, my wife is going into cab.

559
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:23,660
Will you please follow her? Yes, monsieur. It.

560
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,490
Hello.

561
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,210
Goes it? Yes.

562
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,438
Stephen told me that you tried to see me last night.

563
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:05,276
But you see, Tommy.

564
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:09,980
Tommy and I, we went to the cinema, the zoo gay.

565
00:36:09,981 --> 00:36:11,932
It was disbanded nearly.

566
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:13,738
Nearly 30 years ago.

567
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,538
And even if it weren't, don't you think you can

568
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:19,350
trust your mother not to do anything to hurt you?

569
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,016
How's Lyn Martin?

570
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:24,410
She all right? Good.

571
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,532
Is that strange? Strange?

572
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:29,758
For a husband to wait in the

573
00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:33,100
phone booth and then nobody rang.

574
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:35,022
Well, it must be a good reason.

575
00:36:35,023 --> 00:36:37,980
I suppose you'll find out when you recover the diamond.

576
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,830
Take care.

577
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,678
How nice of you to come.

578
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,290
Would you like to come through here?

579
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,220
Madame Roger?

580
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:49,510
Permit me not to introduce myself.

581
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,900
Pleasant.

582
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,882
Business is good, I hope.

583
00:37:57,883 --> 00:37:59,990
Are you interested in buying a bar?

584
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,038
I travel a lot.

585
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,550
I buy only what I can carry with me.

586
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:08,068
Their pesheur is not portable.

587
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:10,810
I have 200,000 to invest.

588
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,180
If I had anything valuable for sale.

589
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,218
I would like to see the

590
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:19,550
money first before I talk business.

591
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,690
You know what money looks like?

592
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:24,370
Pieces of paper with numbers

593
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:26,770
and pictures of famous people.

594
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,308
What I want is much rarer.

595
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,410
I've never actually seen it.

596
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,210
You might be able to help me

597
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:41,942
remind now those pieces of paper.

598
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:43,490
There's numbers of them.

599
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,140
I never carry large sums.

600
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:49,482
You never know what might happen if this bar

601
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:52,330
were run by someone less honorable than you.

602
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,342
Thieves might be hiding back there, or

603
00:38:57,343 --> 00:39:00,964
in the other room, or almost anywhere.

604
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,588
Even as I drove here, I might have been robbed.

605
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:06,510
Criminals seem to be getting bolder every day.

606
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,970
When and where?

607
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,080
This evening.

608
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,358
And I want to examine my

609
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:19,590
purchase while I count the money.

610
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,920
830 at the deserted hangar.

611
00:39:24,921 --> 00:39:28,660
3 miles north of Colomb Sumont.

612
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,860
3 miles north of Colomb Sumont.

613
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,900
You know, I am cursed with a suspicious turn of mind.

614
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:39,812
It's made me a pessimist.

615
00:39:39,813 --> 00:39:41,780
I always expect the worst.

616
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:44,190
Of course, I try to guard against it.

617
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,328
Lynn Martin.

618
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:50,270
She should be excellent insurance.

619
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,280
That's why she's being held.

620
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:56,908
Oh, she's uncomfortable being tied and blindfolded.

621
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:59,200
But she'll be fine once she's released.

622
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,010
As soon as you and I conclude our little business deal.

623
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,600
It's been a pleasure, madame. OJ.

624
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,050
What do we do now?

625
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,050
Don't follow.

626
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,580
They've kidnapped Lyn Martin.

627
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:57,420
He's going to be looking for a tail.

628
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,890
He thinks he sprung a trap that might kill her.

629
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,240
How do you know she's still alive?

630
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,302
Hello?

631
00:41:14,303 --> 00:41:16,140
Is that the beauty parlor?

632
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,812
Yes, yes, this is Anthony Martin.

633
00:41:17,813 --> 00:41:19,310
I'd like to speak to my wife, please.

634
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:20,062
Oh, yes, of course.

635
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:21,210
Just a moment, sir.

636
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,790
I don't know why I ever listened to you.

637
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,736
Kidnapped.

638
00:41:27,737 --> 00:41:29,550
They're calling her to the phone now.

639
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,222
Look, what would be the point of your ridiculous story?

640
00:41:47,223 --> 00:41:48,618
I mean, if they.

641
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:51,690
Yes, Sal.

642
00:41:51,691 --> 00:41:53,034
Something awful has happened.

643
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:53,990
She's gone.

644
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
That's impossible.

645
00:41:56,801 --> 00:41:59,082
No, she's not there.

646
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,518
I don't know what has happened. She must be there.

647
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,022
I mean, she left the house not long ago.

648
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:05,220
She said she was going to the beauty park. The airdress.

649
00:42:05,221 --> 00:42:07,000
He's bound and he gagged.

650
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,760
It's awful.

651
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,930
Where is she?

652
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,790
Where in heaven's name is she?

653
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,358
I don't understand what's going on around here?

654
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,526
Is this some sort of game?

655
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:26,630
Look, I'll pay anything, but where is she?

656
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:27,980
I don't know, Martin.

657
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:29,324
That's the truth.

658
00:42:29,325 --> 00:42:30,690
Now, listen to me.

659
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,308
The beauty parlor will have phoned the police

660
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:35,526
by this time, and they'll be calling here

661
00:42:35,527 --> 00:42:38,298
any minute now, you're to tell them to

662
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:40,842
do absolutely nothing for the next 12 hours.

663
00:42:40,843 --> 00:42:41,590
You understand?

664
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,678
You are not alone, obviously.

665
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:05,386
And the gentleman friend.

666
00:43:05,387 --> 00:43:08,070
Fortunately, I thought to bring a friend too.

667
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,782
Well, we came to do business.

668
00:43:14,783 --> 00:43:17,420
Madame Roche May wish to Count Sis.

669
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:20,626
Our terms included the release of Lynn Martin. Right.

670
00:43:20,627 --> 00:43:22,792
You get the star for the amount agreed

671
00:43:22,793 --> 00:43:25,170
to as soon as you let her go.

672
00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:26,880
Come, please.

673
00:43:26,881 --> 00:43:28,240
We'll follow.

674
00:43:28,241 --> 00:43:29,634
No, no.

675
00:43:29,635 --> 00:43:31,398
At least they can be certain that our car

676
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:35,360
is not equipped with any electronic homing device.

677
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,382
Please come, monsieur.

678
00:43:42,383 --> 00:43:43,940
I take your watch, please.

679
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,612
Claude, you check them out, please.

680
00:43:51,613 --> 00:43:52,600
I take the case.

681
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,984
Okay, madam, if you please, in the

682
00:44:07,985 --> 00:44:09,500
rear of the car with me.

683
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,100
Thank you.

684
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,360
Tell him to come on out here. Who?

685
00:45:59,361 --> 00:46:02,060
The guy you've got guarding Lynn Martin.

686
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,620
Naturally.

687
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:17,478
Paul just want to see that we

688
00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:19,494
maintain a balance of power here.

689
00:46:19,495 --> 00:46:57,490
Okay, Anosh it.

690
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,438
Did you really believe that we would pay for

691
00:47:02,439 --> 00:47:04,646
what is ours or that you would live?

692
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:06,364
Do you have the diamond?

693
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,970
Madame's purse, I believe.

694
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,970
Oh, well.

695
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:36,410
Oh, well, it stay where you are.

696
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,450
Sorry.

697
00:47:52,340 --> 00:48:00,930
Here's no here.

698
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,814
We'll wrap up our hosts. Will you?

699
00:48:03,815 --> 00:48:06,278
George would like to get anonymous call right by now.

700
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:17,160
You think you evidence.

701
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:32,648
Lieutenant Roger, please.

702
00:48:32,649 --> 00:48:34,980
Police will be here very soon.

703
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,272
There you are.

704
00:48:37,273 --> 00:48:39,794
Oh, you stinking, lousy pigs.

705
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:41,244
Just let me get my hands.

706
00:48:41,245 --> 00:48:45,640
Load, you local dirty low down light.

707
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:48,200
You'll be all right.

708
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:50,380
Help yourself.

709
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:51,430
Drinks, boys.

710
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,640
Dirty. Load out. Light.

711
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,220
She's all right.

712
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:07,466
He's even fonder of her than he is of applause.

713
00:49:07,467 --> 00:49:08,480
It's possible.

714
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:13,156
Me, I'm fond of the 200,000

715
00:49:13,157 --> 00:49:14,750
we picked up to the hospital.

716
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,468
I thought you two were supposed to be in.

717
00:49:20,469 --> 00:49:23,726
Can't you want to see the beautiful people tonight?

718
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:24,580
I did.

719
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:27,032
Was he always so stubborn, or is it something

720
00:49:27,033 --> 00:49:28,654
to do with him being on the police?

721
00:49:28,655 --> 00:49:29,934
Oh, he's impossible.

722
00:49:29,935 --> 00:49:32,028
I can't imagine why I put up with him.

723
00:49:32,029 --> 00:49:34,722
Well, because I am witty and amusing.

724
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:36,572
And if you play your cards right,

725
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,306
you'll get dinner out of me tonight.

726
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:39,960
I figured there was a reason.

727
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:45,968
Well, she got to wear her

728
00:49:45,969 --> 00:49:48,416
diamond after all, didn't she? Yeah.

729
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:52,380
Yes, thanks to the police who recovered it.

730
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,840
Martin gave a $10,000 award to the police fund.

731
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,588
You would have liked that

732
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:03,348
for your hospital, wouldn't you?

733
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:05,890
Oh, well, money isn't everything, George.

734
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:08,580
They're happy and you're happy, so we're happy.

735
00:50:08,581 --> 00:50:11,680
Like I always say, you win some, you lose some.

736
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,892
Well, have a lovely time. You too. Oh, we will. We will.

737
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:18,900
Bye. Bye. Bye. It.
