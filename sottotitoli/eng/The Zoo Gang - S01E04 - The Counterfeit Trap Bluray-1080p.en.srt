1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,276
You okay?

2
00:00:04,277 --> 00:00:05,950
We go on a lion hunt.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,560
I like it.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,692
I love it.

5
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:12,270
You fool.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,690
Crack talk, will you?

7
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:26,200
No matter what, where or when, the others are there.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,880
Native Scott has been there.

9
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,220
Honest unsell. Rubbish.

10
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:27,220
Never a breath of scandal.

11
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,558
They'll extradite him and his

12
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:31,262
government will shoot him. It's pity. Quite a guy.

13
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:32,654
You know, in South America he

14
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:34,280
was considered a Robin Hood.

15
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,840
Guess who the clever cop was who arrested him? You. Why?

16
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:43,208
I had no choice.

17
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,710
His passport was phony and he made a run for it.

18
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,238
Yes, yes, I know.

19
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,948
There are only a few students demonstrating,

20
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,702
but I want it broken up.

21
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,542
Arrest a few of them.

22
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:02,474
They'll soon forget Leon when they find themselves

23
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,980
facing a judge at the jail sentence.

24
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,000
A storm in a teacup.

25
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,248
My teacup.

26
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:13,190
I am responsible for order.

27
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,910
This is all I needed.

28
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:18,974
Two telephone calls already.

29
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:21,140
One from his consul demanding

30
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:23,524
instant extradition for Leon.

31
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:25,518
And our Lord and master was on the

32
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,450
telephone from Paris at 08:00 this morning.

33
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:32,114
He is sorry that Elion ever set foot in this country.

34
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:33,944
Here's an embarrassment.

35
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:36,430
He'll be off your hands in one or two days.

36
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,168
Good morning, Colonel Mata.

37
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,326
Now, if you have come to pull one of your

38
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:46,358
special Branch tricks, like arranging some phony escape, would you

39
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:49,228
kindly wait till Leon is out of my jurisdiction?

40
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:50,822
I don't propose to have my

41
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,740
record marred for anybody's sake.

42
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:56,336
I am here to ensure that the man does not escape.

43
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,032
My superiors give me orders.

44
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:00,730
I follow them whether I like them or not.

45
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:04,336
If I had my choice, I'd be delighted to see Ele escape.

46
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,158
I've been assigned an office here.

47
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,918
I am instructed to commend the

48
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,052
officer who affected the arrest.

49
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:11,972
Sir, you have shown outstanding

50
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:14,132
zeal, initiative and courage.

51
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,844
This commendation will be entered

52
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:17,294
in your service record.

53
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,694
It may be some small satisfaction to you to

54
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,018
know that you have been instrumental in putting a

55
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:24,360
brave man in front of a firing squad.

56
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:26,450
But how could I have possibly known who it was?

57
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,432
Dismissed.

58
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:28,460
The brave.

59
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,698
Please instruct the warden that there is

60
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:35,272
to be maximum security, solitary confinement.

61
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:38,076
No contact, no visitors unless

62
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:40,262
personally approved by me.

63
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:42,246
All movement orders will only

64
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:45,050
repeat, only emanate from me.

65
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:48,096
All orders to be in writing and only valid

66
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,802
if confirmed verbally by me within the hour.

67
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:53,482
But if neither this service nor

68
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:55,440
any other government agency were involved.

69
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,118
I know a group of people.

70
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,388
They're professionals.

71
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:00,860
Small green men from Mars.

72
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,452
They'd need to arrive by flying

73
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:03,940
salsa to free this prisoner.

74
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:07,188
You're asking us to break into freshou prison.

75
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:09,298
And after we get there, all we have

76
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:11,432
to do is overwhelm the guards and abduct

77
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:15,042
some South American revolutionary and spirit him away

78
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:17,730
beyond the reach of the authorities. That's all.

79
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:18,818
I don't ask.

80
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:20,030
I haven't the right.

81
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,006
I just hope you'll consider what might be done.

82
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:26,150
And if the thing is worth doing okay.

83
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,090
Why us?

84
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,340
A man is in prison.

85
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:30,758
A man rather like the one you

86
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,678
risked your lives for in 1942.

87
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:35,034
Andre, concierge, snatched from under the

88
00:06:35,035 --> 00:06:37,024
noses of the SS Corps.

89
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:38,816
Operational Caution rose.

90
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,362
That was a long time ago.

91
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:42,154
What's that got to do with it?

92
00:06:42,155 --> 00:06:46,234
Are you too old or too respectable? Respectable? Me?

93
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:47,560
Well, you're joking.

94
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,158
Perhaps you're right.

95
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,838
It isn't 1942.

96
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,174
The present Zoo Gang, about which I'm supposed to

97
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:57,582
know nothing at all, operates for excitement, for fun,

98
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,770
and not because something is worth doing.

99
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,594
I really don't think you're in a

100
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:07,042
position to judge what we're doing.

101
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:08,258
Perhaps you're right.

102
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:10,162
I apologize. Thank you for that.

103
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,320
No, wait a minute.

104
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:13,460
You remember we made a pact

105
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:15,724
to raise money for a hospital.

106
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:19,388
If I find some amusing opportunity for you to acquire

107
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:21,810
a large sum of money, I'll let you all know.

108
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,660
Oh, boy, he's steaming.

109
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,824
I think we got to look at this thing coldly.

110
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,952
You don't trust Roj?

111
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,898
Well, the Zoo Gang is supposed to be the

112
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:36,266
four of us, not anyone from the outside.

113
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:39,614
Oh, he knows who we are and what we do.

114
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:41,598
Now, all I said was that we have to look

115
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,174
at the job coldly, not the man who brought it.

116
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:47,438
Since the man happens to be my son, I

117
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,218
suppose I better not say what I think we

118
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,790
ought to do in case I'm not cold enough.

119
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,592
I didn't relish the idea of El Leon

120
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:58,098
being knocked off by some tinpot general.

121
00:07:58,099 --> 00:07:59,528
No, I'd vote we have a shot

122
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:04,076
at it, even without Minutiae's vote.

123
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:06,210
That's two out of three.

124
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,660
Okay, we go on a lion hunt.

125
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,429
Um, 32 minutes from Martin's over here.

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:49,420
The warden's talking to Martin, checking on this lion.

127
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:51,546
He finances his revolution with money

128
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:53,738
stolen from his government's banks and

129
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:56,064
with ransom paid by frightened officials.

130
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:58,420
What do I care about his finances?

131
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,500
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,228
Go on.

133
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:10,690
The revolutionary Fund has well over a million francs

134
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:15,080
on deposit in Switzerland, and he controls it.

135
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,274
A dead man can't lead a revolution.

136
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:22,012
Nor could he spend the money.

137
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:27,850
Whereas we could if he paid heavily to be freed.

138
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,778
You do have some interesting ideas.

139
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:33,892
That is, of course, the matter

140
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:36,346
of Colonel Martin's precautions against escape.

141
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:38,420
And you have some thoughts about

142
00:09:38,421 --> 00:09:40,282
how to get around the colonel.

143
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:43,630
Do you remember Lieutenant Roger?

144
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,898
George Roger.

145
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,750
You understand the government position certainly, sir.

146
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:54,088
You see, it is really the only way

147
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:56,980
to relieve us of a very distressing situation.

148
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,226
Of course, this is in confidence.

149
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:02,930
If there were a leak, it would be denied.

150
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:04,652
I understand, sir.

151
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:07,244
I am sure your people do not care about money.

152
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:09,350
They are idealists.

153
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,734
But even idealists have expenses.

154
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:18,672
Well, 50,000 is not to be sneezed at, I guess.

155
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:21,072
Listen, who's sneezing? I'm not. Then you'll do it?

156
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:23,170
Of course we do it, George.

157
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:25,252
Figure we're on the job already.

158
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:26,610
Thank you.

159
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:29,322
My principal does not want to know any of the details.

160
00:10:29,323 --> 00:10:32,640
He only asks that you deliver the prisoner here.

161
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,550
Just past kilometer 33 on the upper road, turn north.

162
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:43,640
Now, this is a very secret place.

163
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:45,240
Special Forces center.

164
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,038
You deliver him there and they'll

165
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,398
take him across the frontier.

166
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,548
Well, if we can get him out of

167
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,202
prison, we can get him across the frontier.

168
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:54,530
No, we cannot risk another accidental capture.

169
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:55,484
They take over.

170
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:57,210
No, that's no good.

171
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:58,768
More people who know about it, the less

172
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,790
chance we have of the plan succeeding.

173
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,270
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,900
That's how it has to be.

175
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,450
Good luck.

176
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,700
Well, thanks a lot.

177
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,192
I don't like it. I don't like it either.

178
00:11:14,193 --> 00:11:15,956
I don't think we can get in that prison. No?

179
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:17,412
Stephen and I monitored their

180
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:19,092
telephone traffic all day.

181
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:21,028
I mean, the governor calls Martin every

182
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:22,948
time our guy goes the John almost.

183
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,630
Permission comes down in writing by motorcycle.

184
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,590
Takes about half an hour.

185
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:28,878
Everything in writing.

186
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,820
I know what I think. Yeah.

187
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,944
It's not Operation Cushion rose at all.

188
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:35,854
It's Operation Zebra.

189
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:38,764
Montpelier, 1944.

190
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:39,900
That's it.

191
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:45,186
Right now we'll need their note paper and a stamp.

192
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,140
I'll see to that.

193
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:47,682
Yeah, I'll take care of the transportation.

194
00:11:47,683 --> 00:11:50,188
We need two bikes for a start. What kind of car?

195
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:52,592
We need government standard black. Okay.

196
00:11:52,593 --> 00:11:53,526
And an ambulance.

197
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:54,742
Can you take care of the monitoring?

198
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:57,264
I'll get the wardrobe. It smells good. I like it.

199
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:58,128
I like it.

200
00:11:58,129 --> 00:11:59,260
I love it.

201
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,454
Orders have been received for your transfer to Paris.

202
00:12:06,455 --> 00:12:09,950
Extradition cases are processed through Fran prison.

203
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,760
I am sorry.

204
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,328
You're a brave man.

205
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:16,180
I've always admired you.

206
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,340
What will happen to your cause when you are no longer.

207
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,040
When you are no longer available to lead it?

208
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,924
When I am dead, as when I

209
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:33,820
am alive, the fight will go on.

210
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:34,988
I do hope, sir.

211
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:39,210
Too often the man dies and the cause is fatally hurt.

212
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,910
Now, something should be arranged.

213
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:46,336
Some way to spare you for a cause.

214
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:49,344
If only it were possible for you to escape. How much?

215
00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:50,976
A million francs. Interested?

216
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:52,484
In view of the alternative, do

217
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:55,092
you have that kind of money? We have that money. Here.

218
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:55,760
Yes.

219
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,572
The chief administrator has much

220
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:01,012
sympathy for your cause.

221
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,270
His sympathy?

222
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,540
It comes with a million francs. No.

223
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,090
Yes, that's right.

224
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:44,660
09:00 in the morning.

225
00:13:44,661 --> 00:13:46,090
Very good, Leonard.

226
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,310
Thank you, Bonchance. Good luck.

227
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,154
The attempt will be made tomorrow.

228
00:13:54,155 --> 00:13:56,344
If they fail, we're no worse off.

229
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:59,300
If they succeed, they collect the million.

230
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,640
Warden's office, please.

231
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,172
Yes, the warden, please.

232
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:13,640
Ministry here.

233
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,750
Colonel Martan.

234
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,596
Good morning. Marta here.

235
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:24,944
I have some news for you.

236
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:26,054
One of my men has managed

237
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:28,430
to infiltrate the Freedom Front meeting.

238
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:29,850
Now listen carefully.

239
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,448
They plan to ambush the escort and free

240
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:34,350
their leader on their way to the airfield.

241
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,890
I don't know how they know, Warden.

242
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:38,132
Obviously someone has talked.

243
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,320
I can assure you it wasn't anyone in this office.

244
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,818
Revise procedure as follows.

245
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:48,008
One decoy van and escort detail provided by you will

246
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:51,342
leave at 900 hours and take route to cavalry.

247
00:14:51,343 --> 00:14:53,048
Abort two.

248
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:55,048
At 910 hours a prisoner will be

249
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:58,318
handed over to Captain Le Paso Charles,

250
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:05,442
352176, Sea Company, 107th Mobile Regiment CRS. CRS.

251
00:15:05,443 --> 00:15:08,764
Escort provided by this office. Three.

252
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:11,008
This order cancels my two nine three.

253
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:12,784
Confirming order two nine four will be

254
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:18,038
sent by dispatch Rider Evan Adam.

255
00:15:18,039 --> 00:16:05,820
With us it 25 minutes.

256
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,820
Driving too fast.

257
00:16:22,910 --> 00:17:04,326
But Alex.

258
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:05,180
Let's go.

259
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:33,112
It's no sense in all of us getting

260
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:35,294
caught, so don't give me any argument.

261
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:38,344
I'm not out by 930. You.

262
00:17:38,345 --> 00:18:03,210
It was expected.

263
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,140
Thank you, sir.

264
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,940
It.

265
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,940
It.

266
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:08,940
It.

267
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,750
Home game?

268
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:24,060
Yes, sir.

269
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,940
It.

270
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,410
Take it easy. Relax.

271
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,222
I'd be anymore. Relax.

272
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,940
I've collapsed in the heap on the there.

273
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,278
What's going on here, Babel?

274
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,262
Steve, this is an emergency.

275
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,344
Can't help that.

276
00:21:46,345 --> 00:21:48,380
A man could bleed to death back there.

277
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:49,770
Check their papers.

278
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,264
Sorry.

279
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:58,240
Papers, please.

280
00:21:58,241 --> 00:21:59,798
Did you stop this ambulance?

281
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,494
This man may die.

282
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:03,710
Papers here are mine.

283
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,280
Where are his papers? There.

284
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,460
He's not going to look like that anymore.

285
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,138
What's going on?

286
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:25,190
Prison break.

287
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,190
Hope you catch them.

288
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,670
Thank you.

289
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,710
Back there. Yeah.

290
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,722
We'll take this off soon as we're safe. Oh, wait.

291
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:53,470
There might be some more police roadblocks ahead.

292
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,950
We gone.

293
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,890
Hey, take it easy.

294
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,640
Almost there.

295
00:23:07,641 --> 00:23:08,870
Where is there?

296
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,312
You tell me about your revolution,

297
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:12,710
I'll tell you where is there.

298
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,470
Would you understand?

299
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,660
Possibly.

300
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,780
A movement for National Liberation

301
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:21,770
speaks for very simple people.

302
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,038
They want not liberty as you understand it.

303
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,878
They wouldn't know that. No.

304
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:29,400
They want dignity. Respect.

305
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,554
The general who runs my country, he's forgotten this.

306
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:35,470
He does not respect my people.

307
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,346
He respects only power and money.

308
00:23:39,347 --> 00:23:40,882
That is why we shall win.

309
00:23:40,883 --> 00:23:42,114
I hope you do.

310
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:44,060
You know, you have skill.

311
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:46,370
You handle this matter very well.

312
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,080
It's too bad that you're crooks.

313
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,084
The word is harsh.

314
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:56,618
All right, I will call you adventurers who will do

315
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:58,950
anything as long as the payment is big enough.

316
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,306
Yes, sometimes there's little money in it.

317
00:24:07,307 --> 00:24:09,870
Sometimes there's a lot of money in it.

318
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:12,798
We just do what we fear needs doing.

319
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,702
I have known many like you.

320
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,214
What needs doing, curiously, always

321
00:24:17,215 --> 00:24:19,130
means whatever pays the most.

322
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,610
We're not going to get Rich on you.

323
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:23,794
But I imagine that you will get

324
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,600
a fair share of a million.

325
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:27,778
A million? What million?

326
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:29,842
It's too bad that it won't be paid.

327
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,830
What million?

328
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,358
Pedro's paying Dupont. Who?

329
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,550
Dupont, Inspector General.

330
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:46,298
Million francs? What for?

331
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:47,434
To get him out.

332
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:50,730
But I thought this is an escape to save the government.

333
00:24:50,731 --> 00:24:55,488
But son of observable.

334
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:57,060
Crossing Laos.

335
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,064
Dew point gets the money and he's

336
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,530
a hero for helping the government.

337
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,830
There might be more to it than that. What more?

338
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:07,246
We take all the risks and he gets the big money.

339
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:09,262
What happens after he pays the million?

340
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:11,570
Dupont knows he can blow the whistle, doesn't he?

341
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:13,260
Dead men don't blow whistles.

342
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,886
You can understand how I feel.

343
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,662
I feed you the information, I set

344
00:25:55,663 --> 00:25:57,892
you up, you do the job perfectly.

345
00:25:57,893 --> 00:25:59,732
And then we find that the chief administrators

346
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:01,790
at Crook and I can't prove it. Nobody can.

347
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,664
Nobody can take the blame.

348
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:06,386
You gave us all you had.

349
00:26:06,387 --> 00:26:08,632
You offered no guarantees.

350
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,000
We looked at it coldly

351
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,420
and dispassionately and we agreed.

352
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:15,650
We don't blame you, do we?

353
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,730
So don't blame yourself.

354
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,358
Well, as soon as Dupont gets

355
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,640
hold of that cash, it's goodbye. Pedro.

356
00:26:30,641 --> 00:26:32,048
You don't keep a million francs

357
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,472
in an old sock someplace.

358
00:26:33,473 --> 00:26:34,592
He's got to have a secret

359
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,458
bank account, wouldn't you say?

360
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:38,176
The banks are closed.

361
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:39,640
We have the weekend.

362
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,748
They won't kill him till they're

363
00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:43,278
sure Dupont has the money.

364
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,970
What do you mean you won't pay?

365
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,076
We made an agreement.

366
00:26:47,077 --> 00:26:48,330
This was the deal.

367
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,460
Agreements are made with men of honor, not vermin.

368
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,440
Vermin?

369
00:26:59,441 --> 00:27:00,920
France Madun.

370
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:02,946
Civil servant for 22 years.

371
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:04,072
Very bright.

372
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:06,070
Married, three grown up children.

373
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:08,748
Lives in the luxury apartments, the Avenue Obignon.

374
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:09,820
Thank you, darling.

375
00:27:09,821 --> 00:27:13,078
Holiday house, Portmanic. Oh, Brittany. Too far.

376
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,630
They would never risk transporting a Leon all that way.

377
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:17,810
What have you got?

378
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,048
Concierge gossip.

379
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:21,248
Monsieur is well liked.

380
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:23,504
Entertains a lot, fond of his wife.

381
00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:25,642
Has a mistress in LE.

382
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,510
He might be vulnerable there.

383
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,998
Well, the first thing we have to do

384
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:32,382
is find out where they're keeping him.

385
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:34,574
Well, now, I might have the answer to that.

386
00:27:34,575 --> 00:27:36,260
See, he has a boat.

387
00:27:36,261 --> 00:27:37,400
Motocrus.

388
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,470
Modest as such gin palaces go.

389
00:27:41,471 --> 00:27:45,928
He's only got one hired hand Keeps it at plie mostly.

390
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:47,144
Well, that's private.

391
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:48,322
That might be something.

392
00:27:48,323 --> 00:27:50,568
Well, he just bought a bladdergraph

393
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,120
place in the auntie Bistate.

394
00:27:53,121 --> 00:27:54,508
Very chic.

395
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:57,158
Grand private guards, that sort of thing.

396
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:59,398
If I was going to kidnap myself a

397
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:01,894
millionaire, I know where I'd keep him.

398
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:03,158
Or on a.

399
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,620
We're guessing.

400
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:06,828
Just trying to be logical.

401
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:08,416
Yes, we are logical.

402
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:10,170
And we could be so wrong.

403
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:12,186
If we fail, well, all right, we're wrong.

404
00:28:12,187 --> 00:28:13,898
There's always a tomorrow for us.

405
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:16,100
How many tomorrows are there for Pedro?

406
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,780
Woods burning.

407
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,170
What's on your mind?

408
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,692
I'm thinking of Senora Pedro

409
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:28,756
Ortega, Elion's ever loving wife.

410
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:32,800
Now, Elion says he won't pay, but she will.

411
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:37,912
I announce I am Senora Pedro Ortega, and I'm

412
00:28:37,913 --> 00:28:41,954
frantic because I don't know where my husband is.

413
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:46,260
And I'll pay anything, even a million francs.

414
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:47,644
It's too bloody dangerous.

415
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:49,868
Why don't you wait until Monday? Monday?

416
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:51,308
Pedro's nice and dead.

417
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:53,862
There are a thousand places where they can hide. No.

418
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:58,262
Madame would lead you to him. Don't like.

419
00:28:58,263 --> 00:29:00,940
No, it's too risky, Manoj.

420
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:03,402
No, it's good. Tell you what we do.

421
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:04,768
We compromise.

422
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:06,218
You set it all up.

423
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:09,108
You want to go to a hotel, you go to a hotel.

424
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:09,902
But stay there.

425
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:11,118
Don't leave it till we get back.

426
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,102
Because if we find him at the villa or

427
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:17,000
on the boat, maybe we won't need Senora Ortega.

428
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,184
I think you can handle it, Jill.

429
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:29,900
Don't worry, Uncle Tommy.

430
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,000
Lord Beastar. Mr.

431
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,990
Like Mr. Right. Get in. Get in.

432
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:42,690
I do not believe my husband has escaped.

433
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:44,704
I assure you, madame, he has.

434
00:30:44,705 --> 00:30:48,358
I do not say he has not gone from prison.

435
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:51,414
Many times he has been in prison.

436
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:54,350
Every time he escape.

437
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:57,940
But every time he make a contact with me.

438
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,400
But not this time. Nothing.

439
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,760
Three days. Nothing.

440
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,898
Elion.

441
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,508
He is not free.

442
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:13,358
I tell you, senores, someone abduct him with force.

443
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,166
Do you have any evidence?

444
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,542
I am a woman.

445
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,576
I feel.

446
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:34,982
Here's it'll be puffed.

447
00:31:34,983 --> 00:31:35,312
Yes.

448
00:31:35,313 --> 00:31:39,472
I think I'll just sit down.

449
00:31:39,473 --> 00:31:40,780
But just a moment.

450
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,662
The warmth is marvelous.

451
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:48,272
I do want to see the house.

452
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,502
I know it'll be exactly what I've dreamed.

453
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:52,836
Well, I can't refuse you anything.

454
00:31:52,837 --> 00:31:54,932
All right, my darling. All right. Have a good look.

455
00:31:54,933 --> 00:31:56,404
Have a good look. Take your time.

456
00:31:56,405 --> 00:31:58,122
And if you like the apple blossom.

457
00:31:58,123 --> 00:32:00,980
If you like it, I'll buy it for you.

458
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,168
Sweet, wonderful man.

459
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:08,950
Off you go, my darling. Off you go. Bye bye.

460
00:32:08,951 --> 00:32:10,340
Don't be too long.

461
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:52,410
It's not there's.

462
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,536
Have I seen the laundry port?

463
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:11,060
But, yes, I'd like to see it again.

464
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,700
Thank you.

465
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,380
You it.

466
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,210
Write in your papers.

467
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:43,590
Write that I, his wife, will pay Annie Ransom.

468
00:33:43,591 --> 00:33:44,696
How much?

469
00:33:44,697 --> 00:33:45,780
Never mind.

470
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,620
I will pay.

471
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,170
I seem to have dropped my handkerchief in the bedroom.

472
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,620
Thank you.

473
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,446
Watch.

474
00:34:04,447 --> 00:34:12,900
It's it.

475
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:17,078
You were talking to someone? Myself. I often do that.

476
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:17,969
Don't you?

477
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,558
No, thank you.

478
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,250
You are, dear, for finding this.

479
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,230
Me?

480
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:07,620
Did you mean that?

481
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,260
Of course.

482
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,040
It might be expensive.

483
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,490
Anything.

484
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,010
Let's go now.

485
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,520
Oh, I cannot.

486
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,290
Why not?

487
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,610
Okay.

488
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,480
Ramos.

489
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,242
You see, gentlemen, here for yourself. She's gone. Okay.

490
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:16,978
When did she leave?

491
00:36:16,979 --> 00:36:18,370
And who did she go with?

492
00:36:18,371 --> 00:36:19,298
She didn't tell me.

493
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:20,350
I didn't see.

494
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,622
She's gone, all right.

495
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:28,086
Come up the house talk, will you? Come on. Come on.

496
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:29,330
He doesn't know anything.

497
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,580
Don't worry, senor.

498
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,226
Come this way.

499
00:36:39,227 --> 00:36:41,110
You'll see your husband is all right.

500
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,044
You know I have permission.

501
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:54,120
See my husband alone.

502
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,880
Darling.

503
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,640
Oh, my dad.

504
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,940
Lincoln.

505
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,750
That I see you again.

506
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,610
That I see you again.

507
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,220
Oh, darling.

508
00:37:22,221 --> 00:37:23,558
Hold me close.

509
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:25,596
You should not have come here, my dear.

510
00:37:25,597 --> 00:37:26,902
I'm grateful that you did.

511
00:37:26,903 --> 00:37:28,820
Very grateful that it was a mistake.

512
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,744
I was so afraid.

513
00:37:31,745 --> 00:37:33,802
I knew you would get word to me.

514
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:36,378
If you could just hold me close.

515
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,620
She'll be no trouble.

516
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,288
She begged for the chance to buy his freedom.

517
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:41,002
Don't worry, my dear.

518
00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:42,862
Let's see the color of her money.

519
00:37:42,863 --> 00:37:44,220
You will.

520
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,366
If she suddenly gets a little stubborn, we apply

521
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:49,502
a little pressure on him and on her.

522
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:51,500
One of them will crack.

523
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:52,970
Just get the money.

524
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:06,924
Then we can get rid of both of them, Senora.

525
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:10,240
You are lucky, Senor, to have such a devoted wife.

526
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,484
His life, Signora, will cost 1 million franc.

527
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:18,938
His life, Senor, is worth much

528
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:21,940
more than 1 million franc.

529
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,408
Berry draft on Zurich.

530
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:29,110
How long will it take to clear?

531
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,172
Zhu can be waiting at the bank.

532
00:38:31,173 --> 00:38:32,334
You'll be able to telephone a

533
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:34,920
verification by tomorrow morning at 11:00.

534
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,740
Imani.

535
00:38:37,741 --> 00:38:39,400
It is in the bank.

536
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,848
I do not come here, Senor, to play with the tricks.

537
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:44,990
I hope not.

538
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,480
You are very brave, Carissima.

539
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,332
Brave?

540
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:01,200
DaRlene, I am scarcely.

541
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,934
Fix the news, boy.

542
00:39:35,935 --> 00:39:37,690
He won't deliver till nine.

543
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,400
That ought to be enough to get him worried.

544
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,610
You.

545
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,642
It has been learned that the kidnapping of Ellen was

546
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:12,644
arranged by someone with close links to the Ministry.

547
00:40:12,645 --> 00:40:15,124
According to a high government official.

548
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,000
What high government official?

549
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,988
In the wake of Elaine's disappearance,

550
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:22,480
the Freedom Front has gone underground.

551
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:24,792
Police fear acts of terror.

552
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:26,808
An assassination attempt on the chief

553
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:29,180
administrator himself is not excluded.

554
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,720
Milan. Milan. Get a Richie.

555
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:41,120
Chain down, my dear fellow.

556
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,570
Sorry, dear boy.

557
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,734
Yes, he's the Inspector General.

558
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:53,066
Dubon speaking.

559
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,170
Associated Press.

560
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:56,096
Could you comment on the allegation

561
00:40:56,097 --> 00:40:57,936
that your office is implicated?

562
00:40:57,937 --> 00:41:00,320
It is not rubbish.

563
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:03,300
What about the possible assassination attempt?

564
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,160
No comment.

565
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,758
Pack of lies. No.

566
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,850
You know how unreliable the papers are.

567
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,218
Why should they print that?

568
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:18,642
There is to be an attempt on my

569
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:30,690
life without any basis with this phone.

570
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,130
This line's 32.

571
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,670
Both telephones at the same time.

572
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,016
That is no accident.

573
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:41,540
There's a phone in the Galho.

574
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,568
Tell Pierre to phone my secretary.

575
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,026
Tell her to find out who planted this

576
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:53,022
story and particularly how serious they consider the

577
00:41:53,023 --> 00:41:59,720
threat to be one coming your way, Alec.

578
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,390
Hey, you.

579
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,330
Wake up.

580
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,894
I told him to phone for a repair man.

581
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,220
Tomorrow you get me a dive.

582
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:14,930
Rick blot in here.

583
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,830
What's keeping him?

584
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,750
Yeah.

585
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,630
What delights. What happened?

586
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,672
Fools.

587
00:42:46,673 --> 00:42:48,724
Jean, alert the guards.

588
00:42:48,725 --> 00:42:50,062
Get somebody to fix this.

589
00:42:50,063 --> 00:42:51,220
Get an electrician.

590
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:52,490
Get somebody, anybody.

591
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:57,972
Jean.

592
00:42:57,973 --> 00:42:59,412
First the phone, now the lights.

593
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:00,360
Be careful.

594
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:17,190
You it make do with this for the present.

595
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:22,800
What was that?

596
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,150
Jean.

597
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:31,870
Jean.

598
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,280
Catch him.

599
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:43,612
In South America, the panther cries out like that.

600
00:43:43,613 --> 00:43:48,950
The natives call it guards.

601
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:58,270
Jean, keep the windows covered.

602
00:43:58,271 --> 00:44:00,540
I'll take the car and try and get help.

603
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,020
They will not be expecting a break.

604
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:40,322
Towards the sea.

605
00:44:40,323 --> 00:44:42,322
There is a dinghy by the landing stage.

606
00:44:42,323 --> 00:44:44,332
Take it and row to the boat. Mario is there.

607
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,600
What if they're waiting for me?

608
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:47,206
I will hold their attention.

609
00:44:47,207 --> 00:44:48,780
It is our only chance.

610
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,016
I promise you.

611
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:54,410
Enough time to reach the dinghy.

612
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,612
Tiger. I'm going to cover the front.

613
00:45:08,613 --> 00:45:10,168
It looks like one of them is making a break for it.

614
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:10,958
Elephant.

615
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,380
Stand by to reconnect the lights out.

616
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:18,878
Here are your orders.

617
00:45:18,879 --> 00:45:21,970
Men, move in from all three sides.

618
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:30,444
Antoine, bet you want one.

619
00:45:30,445 --> 00:45:33,960
Take nine or ten men and sweep down to the road.

620
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,330
That you, Paul?

621
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,406
Position your men and shoot.

622
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:46,780
Anything that moves in your area shall move out.

623
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:00,290
Tiger to Fox, tiger to books.

624
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:54,060
You will gain nothing by killing me.

625
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:58,990
You would be caught before you were a mile from here.

626
00:46:58,991 --> 00:47:00,060
Kill you?

627
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,530
We could have done that ten times tonight.

628
00:47:08,531 --> 00:47:11,482
Or 100 times since you have captured Leon.

629
00:47:11,483 --> 00:47:13,588
Exactly my point.

630
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:15,230
No use in killing.

631
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,780
We should do business.

632
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,300
I have something which you want.

633
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,616
We can make a deal.

634
00:47:24,617 --> 00:47:26,248
I am ready to talk terms.

635
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:30,390
No, we do not talk terms about the life of.

636
00:47:30,391 --> 00:47:33,486
And your life, Senor Dupont, is no worse

637
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:36,524
that the police are on their way.

638
00:47:36,525 --> 00:47:38,120
They will be here any moment.

639
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:42,760
Listen, there is a car.

640
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,552
I should have let you reach it.

641
00:47:51,553 --> 00:47:54,050
I would have an excuse to kill you.

642
00:47:54,051 --> 00:47:56,170
But I don't need an excuse.

643
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:59,600
No, please wait.

644
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:06,420
Please wait.

645
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,140
Here.

646
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,184
Take it. There is more.

647
00:48:14,185 --> 00:48:15,220
Take it all.

648
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,624
Yes, sir.

649
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:23,080
I swear it. Where? Take me. To him. Go.

650
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:28,428
You have great faith in those out there.

651
00:48:28,429 --> 00:48:29,640
They'll be here.

652
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,688
Tell me, who are they?

653
00:48:32,689 --> 00:48:34,470
Brothers or lovers?

654
00:48:34,471 --> 00:48:36,220
During the war, when you were young,

655
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,170
we did things together in the Resistance.

656
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,650
My husband got killed.

657
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:46,130
And then when it was all over, we

658
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,800
each went our way, didn't see each other.

659
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:53,002
And we found that it was no good being apart.

660
00:48:53,003 --> 00:48:55,672
Now each one of us knows, no matter

661
00:48:55,673 --> 00:48:58,232
what, where or when the others are.

662
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:07,200
There's.

663
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,290
Give me the key.

664
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,142
Come over.

665
00:49:13,143 --> 00:49:23,658
Here's you.

666
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:25,466
Put your arm around him. That one.

667
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:27,312
Never do it. Photograph.

668
00:49:27,313 --> 00:49:29,060
Yes, but do it, Pedro.

669
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:56,246
Look happy now.

670
00:49:56,247 --> 00:49:56,774
Don't knock him.

671
00:49:56,775 --> 00:49:58,198
He made a lovely contribution to the

672
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:02,108
hospital out of his wall safe. Lovely. Lovely. Lovely.

673
00:50:02,109 --> 00:50:02,954
What?

674
00:50:02,955 --> 00:50:05,800
I feel very satisfied today.

675
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:08,112
Smug, I'd call it. Superior.

676
00:50:08,113 --> 00:50:11,296
Possibly snooty, but definitely smug.

677
00:50:11,297 --> 00:50:13,178
I'd say downright disgusting if I didn't

678
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:15,258
happen to feel exactly the same way.

679
00:50:15,259 --> 00:50:16,848
Do you know, I never thought I'd

680
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:18,624
really ever go on a lion hunt.

681
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:20,138
And the lion got away. Yeah.

682
00:50:20,139 --> 00:50:21,258
That was the best part.

683
00:50:21,259 --> 00:50:22,660
What do you say, Steven?

684
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,980
I say lovely.
