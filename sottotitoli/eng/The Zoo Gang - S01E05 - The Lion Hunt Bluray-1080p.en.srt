1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:04,468
Yeah.

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:06,404
Cheating the cheaters. I like it.

3
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:09,348
It is at risk, but one worth taking.

4
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:10,772
What's in it for me?

5
00:00:10,773 --> 00:00:11,870
Survival.

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,978
It is a trap.

7
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:17,950
We make one small mistake and then we're dead.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,442
Your people have Stephen Halliday.

9
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:26,274
We want him back alive.

10
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:28,550
They just shot one of my motorcycle policemen.

11
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,150
Just balance the extra weight you carry.

12
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,960
That's gold, not lead.

13
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,360
You.

14
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:48,640
It's all right.

15
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,952
Thank you. Thank you very much.

16
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:51,420
Yes, everything's all right.

17
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:11,220
It's all right.

18
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:43,398
Duan.

19
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:52,620
You know, you round the back, you.

20
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,750
How wonderful, dear.

21
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:28,220
Oh, I am so glad you caught them.

22
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:35,332
Oh, George, I have a favor to ask in return. Yes?

23
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,716
Please don't release the story

24
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,150
of the arrest until Wednesday.

25
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,748
Well, I wouldn't suggest it if

26
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:45,390
I didn't think you'd benefit.

27
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,686
After all, you only got the press and the plates.

28
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:51,006
I was hoping you'd get the counterfeit notes

29
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:53,940
and the men who intend to pass them.

30
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,790
All right, darling. Bye.

31
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay.

32
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,002
Paying for smuggled gold with counterfeit notes.

33
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:10,438
I think we ought to be ashamed of ourselves.

34
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:12,224
He's quite neat. Yeah.

35
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:13,318
Cheating the cheaters.

36
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,300
I like it.

37
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,370
For Cousin Charles's party.

38
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,980
See you.

39
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,808
You know, all these things have

40
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:27,184
got the same serial number.

41
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:29,310
I'm going to watch it. Yeah.

42
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:33,250
Alec didn't look too long at the. Oh, yeah. Don't worry.

43
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,710
Madame, monsieur, your attention, if you please.

44
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,140
A toast to my wife, Brigitte.

45
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,324
Happy birthday.

46
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:04,480
Happy birthday.

47
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,170
Please sit down.

48
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,160
It has been a wonderful birthday.

49
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,550
Thanks to you all.

50
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,298
Like a sort of second wedding, which, as

51
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:26,420
you know, we had to have in Paris.

52
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:28,862
And Charles has been feeling so guilty about

53
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:32,126
that because you couldn't all be there.

54
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:34,220
But I was in a show.

55
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:35,610
My last show.

56
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,938
Anyway, we hoped that this party would kind

57
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:44,750
of make it up to you as it.

58
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,818
So, Charlie, we are off the oak now.

59
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:52,540
Can I tell them about my wonderful present? No. Sherry.

60
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,990
Oh, Charlie, please.

61
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:55,200
Please, Charlie.

62
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,330
Not yet.

63
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,310
Oh, well, it seems it's still on the secret list.

64
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,242
Well, I. Shut up.

65
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:04,512
I'm so pie eyed.

66
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:18,158
Anyway, what do you think of her?

67
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,278
Cut in to cut in.

68
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,840
Now, your honest opinion.

69
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,198
Well, she could be good for you. I needed her.

70
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:28,600
Manoush, when a man has outlived two wives.

71
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:31,150
A touch of salmon, old petals, you know.

72
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,460
Don't get scorched.

73
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,070
It is a risk, but one worth taking, don't you think?

74
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,938
Paul, I.

75
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:44,566
Paul, we had given you up for lost. I'm sorry.

76
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:47,740
The fuel pipe was broken. Madame. Join the party.

77
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:48,530
Thank you.

78
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,340
The police.

79
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:56,230
It's following back.

80
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,150
It.

81
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,362
Where have you been these last few months?

82
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:49,670
I've hardly seen anything.

83
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,808
Judge Gochi, thank you for a lovely

84
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:53,190
party, but I have to go.

85
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,992
Gunmen on the loose.

86
00:13:54,993 --> 00:13:58,282
They just shot one of my motorcycle policemen. Where?

87
00:13:58,283 --> 00:13:59,776
It's Sam Flor Le Plierge.

88
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:01,648
Fortunately, the man was able to give a description.

89
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,750
Two young men in a white convertible. So.

90
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,150
Jack, come on. It.

91
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,020
Check out the household.

92
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:26,150
It's it.

93
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,480
It.

94
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,500
Take it and wait in the car.

95
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,308
Bit long in the tooth for all

96
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,030
this sort of thing, aren't you, Granddad?

97
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,028
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't

98
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,300
kill you and take back the gold.

99
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:53,330
Let's do.

100
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:06,662
Okay, Chopa, we got it.

101
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:08,406
We got it. Great.

102
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:10,356
You clean all your stuff out the villa?

103
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:11,694
No, I'm going back there now.

104
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:13,726
You were supposed to clean it out before you left.

105
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,982
Yeah, I know, but I just didn't trust those guys.

106
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:17,646
I wanted to get the gold out of there first.

107
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:18,142
Don't worry.

108
00:17:18,143 --> 00:17:19,278
I'll spring clean the whole place,

109
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,723
right down to the last fingerprint.

110
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:22,414
Just give the key back to the agent when

111
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:23,982
you're locked up, we'll wait for you here.

112
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:31,080
Righteous.

113
00:17:34,580 --> 00:18:00,330
It it.

114
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,660
No move.

115
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:22,840
Not a muscle.

116
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,130
You.

117
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,380
Devin?

118
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:46,320
Alec.

119
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,890
What?

120
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,440
Say that again slowly.

121
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,660
I just got back from the villa.

122
00:18:57,661 --> 00:18:59,028
Those two guys I got the gold

123
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:00,650
from are lying dead in here.

124
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,820
I'm just going to clean up and get out fast.

125
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:05,934
Just so I'd let you know in case anything goes wrong.

126
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:07,440
Hold it, Alec.

127
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:10,146
Once the police find those bodies, the agent

128
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,560
will be able to give a description of. Alec.

129
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:14,902
Alec, listen. You got to get out of there.

130
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,036
Put them in the car, get rid of them around Gordon.

131
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:18,690
We'll pick you up. Okay.

132
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,872
Convertible missing.

133
00:19:56,873 --> 00:19:58,248
Rear license.

134
00:19:58,249 --> 00:19:59,820
Driver is armed.

135
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,936
It's the truth.

136
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,338
They were dead when I found them.

137
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:57,402
I never set eyes on either of them before.

138
00:21:57,403 --> 00:22:00,030
And yet you put them in their car

139
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:02,780
and drove them straight to the mountains.

140
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:04,200
I was confused.

141
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,940
Too confused to pick up a telephone?

142
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:09,620
All right, I'm scared.

143
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:12,324
You'll have to do a lot better than that, Mr. Kathmodi.

144
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:14,904
That villa was a rendezvous.

145
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:16,754
You'd arranged to meet them there.

146
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:20,590
I told you, I don't even know the names of those guys.

147
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,808
The place was unlived in, wiped clean of fingerprints.

148
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:27,942
Oh, I don't use it much.

149
00:22:27,943 --> 00:22:29,078
What is that?

150
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:31,388
Only criminals wipe down, Prince.

151
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:32,460
Monsieur Camoudi.

152
00:22:32,461 --> 00:22:34,716
Criminals who would wish to conceal a crime.

153
00:22:34,717 --> 00:22:35,382
Oh, come on.

154
00:22:35,383 --> 00:22:38,662
What I'm saying is that crime is murder. Come on.

155
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:40,124
What would be my motive?

156
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,196
Gang warfare.

157
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:43,370
How can I get involved with gangs here?

158
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:44,288
You got my passport.

159
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:45,712
I'm a United States citizen.

160
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:47,306
The day staff shows I've been in this country.

161
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:48,042
Two weeks.

162
00:22:48,043 --> 00:22:49,930
Never been here before in my life.

163
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,240
I rented that villa and a car for a month's vacation.

164
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,550
Alec, what are you doing here?

165
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,390
You know that man?

166
00:23:06,391 --> 00:23:07,414
Of course I do.

167
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:10,690
It's Alec Marlowe, one of my mother's oldest friends.

168
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,850
What are we going to do?

169
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,120
Alec's going to be charged with murder.

170
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,060
They could tell him the truth.

171
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,242
No, it wouldn't do any good.

172
00:23:23,243 --> 00:23:25,002
It's still possible he could have killed those guys.

173
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,110
All you can do is find out who really did it.

174
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,920
Couriers are expenditure.

175
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:31,284
That was an execution.

176
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,526
Where are we going to start?

177
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,708
With extreme caution.

178
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:35,770
Now think.

179
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,702
Within 1 hour of that policeman being

180
00:23:38,703 --> 00:23:40,862
shot, the gang heard about it.

181
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:44,498
And now that means that either they

182
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:47,618
have an incredible communication system or they

183
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:49,500
have a spy in the police force.

184
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,652
Either of which makes them uncomfortably smart.

185
00:23:54,653 --> 00:24:00,290
We make one small mistake and we're dead. Hey.

186
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,710
What is it?

187
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:06,534
No visitors for me.

188
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:07,670
You sure?

189
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:09,372
Any phone calls, messages?

190
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:12,180
Nothing, monsieur. Hi. Hi.

191
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:13,434
George is going to release the

192
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:15,354
story of the counterfeit us today.

193
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:18,922
Now, what about that little man who led Alec to them?

194
00:24:18,923 --> 00:24:20,688
Now, Duche's a cheap little hustler.

195
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:21,658
He wouldn't have any kind of

196
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:22,938
contact with anybody high up.

197
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,142
They wouldn't trust him.

198
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,620
All he'd have would be a phone number to call.

199
00:24:26,621 --> 00:24:29,678
Well, I'm going to see Alec now, and I tell

200
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,716
him to look for the serial numbers in the papers.

201
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:33,370
Tell him things are going to start happening.

202
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,448
Visitors?

203
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:07,248
Who says not come back to modern?

204
00:25:07,249 --> 00:25:09,658
Madame, when the prisoner has been charged, I am

205
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,386
sure then that you will be able to.

206
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:12,410
Excuse me.

207
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,068
George.

208
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:16,600
What are they doing to Alec?

209
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,200
Relax.

210
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,880
It's a perfectly normal routine.

211
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,258
Then why can't I see him?

212
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:25,560
He's being questioned.

213
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:28,456
Look, your best bet is Cousin Charles.

214
00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:30,910
He's the examining judge assigned to the case.

215
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,592
Thank you, Rour.

216
00:25:33,593 --> 00:25:35,410
Just one question.

217
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,300
What is going on?

218
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:43,516
On Alec.

219
00:25:43,517 --> 00:25:45,068
What was he doing at the villa?

220
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:47,380
Pretending to be an American tourist.

221
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:51,250
Well, I'm not allowed to see him, so how would I know?

222
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,258
Manous, this is Andre. You met him.

223
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:18,946
I think he just stopped off on his way to.

224
00:26:18,947 --> 00:26:21,394
Yes, yes, of course. How do you do?

225
00:26:21,395 --> 00:26:22,968
My pleasure, madame.

226
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:24,248
Oh, do sit down, Charles.

227
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:28,910
Won't be too long, I hope.

228
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,370
Oh, darling, never in the morning.

229
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,198
Well, Andre's off now.

230
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:37,940
Aren't you, darling? Ciao. Goodbye, madame. Goodbye.

231
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:49,360
Hey, wait, Andre.

232
00:26:49,361 --> 00:26:50,320
Be an Asia.

233
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:52,942
Pop along and get out some cigarettes. Not for me.

234
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:53,716
I don't smoke.

235
00:26:53,717 --> 00:26:55,260
Well, I do.

236
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:57,246
Oh, well, then have some of these.

237
00:26:57,247 --> 00:26:59,204
I bought some for my friend Alec Marlowe.

238
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:01,810
But he doesn't smoke. That much. Well, are you sure?

239
00:27:01,811 --> 00:27:03,042
Help yourself.

240
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:04,350
Thank you very much.

241
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,650
Bye. Andre. Yes?

242
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:09,218
No, don't be shit. Now, come on.

243
00:27:09,219 --> 00:27:13,080
I envelope some coffee.

244
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:14,910
Black or white? Black.

245
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,582
Oh, I shall be so glad to get out of this place.

246
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,988
It's so pokey and suburban.

247
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:22,764
And where can you ride?

248
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:24,420
Do you ride?

249
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:26,140
I was brought up with horses.

250
00:27:26,141 --> 00:27:28,600
Practically lived in the saddle.

251
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:32,020
Papa used to say I should marry a centaur.

252
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,300
Instead, I married Charles.

253
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,540
Charlie.

254
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,430
Have you had a good day?

255
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:43,370
Very good.

256
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,550
Hi.

257
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:49,124
I'm a loosh.

258
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,932
What a pleasant surprise.

259
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:52,056
How are you, Charles?

260
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:54,270
I go make you some fresh coffee. Thank you.

261
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,790
There's something wrong.

262
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,600
I came to see you about Alec Marlowe.

263
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:02,946
You know him?

264
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:06,740
You're the examining judge on the case, aren't? Oh, yes.

265
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:10,450
I'd like to visit him, take him a few things. Okay.

266
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:23,568
Oh, my dear, I'm afraid

267
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,064
you're asking something rather delicate.

268
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:29,480
The answer is no, regrettably.

269
00:28:29,481 --> 00:28:31,910
But how do you happen to know a man like that?

270
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,660
He's one of my oldest and dearest friends.

271
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:39,438
Thank you, but you astonish me.

272
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:40,958
You seem to have made up your

273
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,910
mind in advance about this case.

274
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,346
There appears to be some

275
00:28:45,347 --> 00:28:47,170
considerable evidence against him.

276
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:48,306
Well, it's wrong.

277
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:50,146
I've known him since the war.

278
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:55,532
He and Tommy Devon, Steve Halliday, myself and Claude.

279
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,358
My husband was killed, remember?

280
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:00,774
Well, we were all in the Resistance together.

281
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:03,700
And I vouch for this man with my life.

282
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,440
With my life, Charles.

283
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,010
I see.

284
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,294
Rest assured, my loosh.

285
00:29:18,295 --> 00:29:20,060
I will keep an open mind.

286
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,254
Breathe.

287
00:29:47,255 --> 00:29:57,142
That fakes.

288
00:29:57,143 --> 00:29:58,220
All of them.

289
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,820
We've been had, every life won.

290
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,470
Fakes.

291
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,110
He paid us in fakes.

292
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,588
I still think it's a waste of time.

293
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:10,954
You said yourself that Pierre

294
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:12,298
Ducher is a cheap hustler.

295
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:14,650
He got no real connection with the smugglers.

296
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:16,344
He can get a message to him.

297
00:30:16,345 --> 00:30:17,512
But we do know that much.

298
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:19,400
It's our only real lead.

299
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,696
Tommy, we've got one more.

300
00:30:20,697 --> 00:30:22,430
Not Brigitte's counterfeit note.

301
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:23,560
That doesn't prove anything.

302
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:25,198
Except the stuff's in circulation.

303
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,664
But where did she get it?

304
00:30:26,665 --> 00:30:28,568
She didn't get it from the judge, did she?

305
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:29,966
Maybe her boyfriend.

306
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:31,438
A goal is in diving weights.

307
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:33,030
He's got a yacht.

308
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,728
Maybe we should follow that up.

309
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:35,608
She could have got it from

310
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:38,010
the butcher, the super markers anywhere.

311
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:32,470
It is. This your van?

312
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:33,478
Of course it's my van.

313
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,960
What are you doing to it?

314
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,064
Come inside.

315
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:41,462
Inside what for? Your push.

316
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:43,510
You have only the one headlamp.

317
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:46,436
You have no backplate of registration. You're crazy.

318
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,732
No registration disc.

319
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:49,482
That is three laws you have broken.

320
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:50,858
No, I've got witnesses.

321
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:52,548
Then swear there is nothing wrong with you.

322
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:54,590
Where are the witnesses?

323
00:31:54,591 --> 00:32:03,170
Does anyone here wish to appear in the courtroom?

324
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,472
Put your hands there.

325
00:32:06,473 --> 00:32:08,242
Update my protection.

326
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:09,880
Not to me you have not.

327
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,434
No weapons, eh?

328
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:14,250
Have you any dogs?

329
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:16,018
Ametamine. Whiskey.

330
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:19,088
Where's the whiskey your friend smuggled for you?

331
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:20,250
Any gold?

332
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,260
Perhaps I should search all of your customers.

333
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:33,610
We have a little search, huh?

334
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,690
All of your witnesses are gone.

335
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:38,850
Something I said? You think?

336
00:32:38,851 --> 00:32:40,080
What do you want?

337
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:44,238
The charge is serious.

338
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:45,694
What charge?

339
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:47,160
The dogs I found.

340
00:32:47,161 --> 00:32:48,660
You didn't find any.

341
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,934
So a shakedown.

342
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:57,480
But of course you cam.

343
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,972
How much?

344
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:02,520
One phone call.

345
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,310
Some friends of yours have lost some gold.

346
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,388
A man calling himself Carmody has

347
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:10,982
made a confession at headquarters.

348
00:33:10,983 --> 00:33:12,336
Now I know where the gold is.

349
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:14,860
This should be very valuable to your friends.

350
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,976
You will contact them, give them my name.

351
00:33:18,977 --> 00:33:20,530
Which is it?

352
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:21,668
And their number.

353
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:23,150
You understand, Pierre?

354
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,600
Suppose I do what you say?

355
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,536
What's in it for me?

356
00:33:34,537 --> 00:33:35,650
Survival.

357
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:43,830
His name is Patrolman Jean Blanchard.

358
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,532
The number he wants you to call him at is nice.

359
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:49,692
76035.

360
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:51,610
Attend tomorrow morning.

361
00:33:51,611 --> 00:33:52,760
End of message.

362
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,852
A crooked cop.

363
00:33:57,853 --> 00:34:08,909
How about that piece of lucky?

364
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,550
It is a trap.

365
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,960
You all right? Yeah.

366
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,820
What happened?

367
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:45,924
Two men.

368
00:35:45,925 --> 00:35:47,360
I thought they were customers.

369
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,604
They asked to see something, and

370
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,590
then they suddenly grabbed me.

371
00:35:51,591 --> 00:35:53,060
What did they take?

372
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,770
I couldn't see, but they took the safe. Keys.

373
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,448
Hey, are you sure you're all right? Yeah.

374
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:04,440
Feel well enough to check the stock? Yes. Okay.

375
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,550
Haven't touched the thing.

376
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,696
Find anything missing?

377
00:36:18,697 --> 00:36:19,630
Not yet.

378
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,260
They know who we are.

379
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:14,020
Stephen, are you calling the police?

380
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,810
Jill, call Minosh for me.

381
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:22,048
Tell doesn't make me at Steve's

382
00:37:22,049 --> 00:38:00,600
place right away, but over.

383
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:02,282
You mean a deal that these

384
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:04,230
too many loose ends turn down?

385
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,008
I'm sorry, but I'm rather both proud.

386
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:12,752
This is going to be a painful interrogation.

387
00:38:12,753 --> 00:38:14,720
I don't want you to break things.

388
00:38:14,721 --> 00:39:09,660
That's Hong Steve's glasses.

389
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,270
They've got him.

390
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,030
How?

391
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,550
Well, how could they find him?

392
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,108
All he gave them was the false

393
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:21,910
name and his private telephone number.

394
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:23,468
Can't find an address from a private

395
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:30,900
telephone number unless they have police authority.

396
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,378
Remember how quickly they learned that their

397
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:36,106
man had shot their patrol man?

398
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,350
Remember what you said?

399
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,792
They must have a spy in the police.

400
00:39:39,793 --> 00:39:41,270
So that's how they got.

401
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,730
Now, how can that help us find them?

402
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,110
How did they find my place?

403
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,860
How did they make the connection?

404
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,320
I did call to see Alec.

405
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,916
But how did they make the jump

406
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:13,510
between you, me and Stephen Charles? Was that.

407
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,558
Well, I did tell him that

408
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:17,490
you three were my oldest friends.

409
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,512
Judge Godier, that counterfeit note.

410
00:40:24,513 --> 00:40:25,830
Brigitte head.

411
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,540
The Otlam diving.

412
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,242
Well, where can I find them?

413
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,192
This is very urgent.

414
00:40:47,193 --> 00:40:48,776
They are viewing their new house, madame.

415
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:51,298
They're going to move. Where to? Not far.

416
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:53,096
We're handling the sale of both properties.

417
00:40:53,097 --> 00:40:54,914
So I can give you their address if you like.

418
00:40:54,915 --> 00:40:56,190
Yes, please.

419
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,246
I'll say it again.

420
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,342
You're wasting your time. We sold it.

421
00:41:00,343 --> 00:41:05,740
Consignment, aliding.

422
00:41:05,741 --> 00:41:07,890
Transactions like that take days.

423
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,270
We presold it. Days?

424
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
A lot of preparation.

425
00:41:13,801 --> 00:41:16,458
Screening of clients, bargaining the

426
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:19,700
price, pickup points, couriers, alibis.

427
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,030
You're going to tell us whether it is or not.

428
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,630
Knock on the deck.

429
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,030
All right, I'll tell you.

430
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,818
Alec, the guy in jail, he hid it.

431
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:14,870
Buried it.

432
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,100
Where?

433
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,894
In the villa before he left.

434
00:42:18,895 --> 00:42:20,040
He's lying.

435
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,890
I searched every centimeter. You sure?

436
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,614
That tells me one thing.

437
00:42:27,615 --> 00:42:31,182
You killed those couriers for what

438
00:42:31,183 --> 00:43:07,800
could it do you manous?

439
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,134
How did you find us? Have you seen?

440
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:12,692
Isn't it fantastic?

441
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:14,238
This is the secret I was trying to

442
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:16,676
tell you about my birthday present from Charles.

443
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,770
How do you do?

444
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,040
Charles, we have to talk to you alone.

445
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,680
It's urgent.

446
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:25,280
What is wrong?

447
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:27,730
Please, Sherry, can you amuse yourself?

448
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:28,978
Just for a little while?

449
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:33,200
We go and say hello to your sister.

450
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:47,124
If this concerns your friend Marlowe, you must understand it

451
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,780
will be unethical for me to discuss the case.

452
00:43:49,781 --> 00:43:50,910
Where's Stephen?

453
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,084
What are you talking about?

454
00:43:54,085 --> 00:43:55,882
Your people have Stephen Halliday.

455
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,818
We want him back alive.

456
00:43:57,819 --> 00:43:59,890
Now we'll make a deal.

457
00:43:59,891 --> 00:44:04,042
The gold for Halliday, 24 hours, head starred,

458
00:44:04,043 --> 00:44:06,568
plus the gold in exchange for his life.

459
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:07,736
What do you say?

460
00:44:07,737 --> 00:44:10,690
Say, I am fascinated.

461
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,832
You come to me with some wild story.

462
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,922
Accusations, no proof.

463
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:18,444
Once we give the police a lead, how long do

464
00:44:18,445 --> 00:44:20,434
you think it'll take them to dig up proof?

465
00:44:20,435 --> 00:44:23,398
We release the story and I'll give them proof.

466
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:26,970
Freedom or a murder charge.

467
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:29,930
Two couriers.

468
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,878
I will make arrangements.

469
00:44:52,879 --> 00:44:55,038
Bring the gold to my villa in Lise.

470
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:56,870
08:00 tonight.

471
00:44:56,871 --> 00:44:57,950
Stephen.

472
00:44:57,951 --> 00:44:59,060
He'll be there.

473
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,078
Remember your promise.

474
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,978
24 hours if you live up to your half of the bargain.

475
00:45:06,979 --> 00:45:08,188
You need not believe me.

476
00:45:08,189 --> 00:45:09,640
I don't suppose you will.

477
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,508
Of course I knew what was going on.

478
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,390
I didn't inform the police.

479
00:45:14,391 --> 00:45:16,030
I needed money.

480
00:45:16,031 --> 00:45:17,580
I was offered a share.

481
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,130
I never intended to become involved with murder.

482
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,770
That I was in too deep.

483
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,440
Anyway, it doesn't really matter now, does it?

484
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,314
Yacht club.

485
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:51,482
Judge Gortier.

486
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:53,760
Connect me with the communications room.

487
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,290
Evening, Dave.

488
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,782
We didn't bring him, Charles.

489
00:46:29,783 --> 00:46:33,558
We agreed that manush.

490
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:35,390
He may have, but I didn't.

491
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,000
Your Ignition keys, please.

492
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:07,910
We felt your plan left us a little insecure.

493
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,380
Once you had your friend back.

494
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:12,284
We only had your word that the police would not pick us

495
00:47:12,285 --> 00:47:16,492
up on the way to the boat, so we decided to keep

496
00:47:16,493 --> 00:47:22,290
him as hostage until we were safe from interception of it.

497
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:23,790
Not unreasonable.

498
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:49,900
Wow.

499
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:51,270
Let's check the gold.

500
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,612
If you want to see your friend

501
00:47:53,613 --> 00:47:56,840
dive again, don't try to follow me.

502
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,290
Judge.

503
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:00,760
Let me go to you.

504
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,200
Oh, wait.

505
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,240
My share.

506
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,318
You mean you actually wanted them to double cross you?

507
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,438
We were banking on it.

508
00:49:19,439 --> 00:49:20,868
It was for they hadn't.

509
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:22,434
Well, and they wouldn't be in jail, and

510
00:49:22,435 --> 00:49:24,424
we wouldn't be sitting here full of champagne.

511
00:49:24,425 --> 00:49:25,752
And we wouldn't have the gold

512
00:49:25,753 --> 00:49:28,546
for the orthopedic wing celebration. Yes.

513
00:49:28,547 --> 00:49:29,794
Brigitte, may I sit down?

514
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:31,010
Sit down, please.

515
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,686
Well, I don't blame you.

516
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:36,246
I wish I had something to. I'm sorry.

517
00:49:36,247 --> 00:49:37,574
Ah, don't be.

518
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:40,438
You know, I was looking for someone to say goodbye to.

519
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:42,186
I refuse to slink away.

520
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,144
It just isn't my scene.

521
00:49:44,145 --> 00:49:45,578
Good for you.

522
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:46,950
Where are you off to?

523
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,480
Back to Paris.

524
00:49:49,481 --> 00:49:52,378
I know it's a runout, but I sold all the

525
00:49:52,379 --> 00:49:55,248
furs and jewels that Charles gave me for his defense.

526
00:49:55,249 --> 00:49:57,230
So I figure that wipes the slate clean.

527
00:49:57,231 --> 00:49:58,730
Now I have to think of me.

528
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,956
I may get quite drunk on the plane tonight.

529
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,278
It'll make the ride seem less

530
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:05,028
like the retreat from Moscow.

531
00:50:05,029 --> 00:50:06,878
No hard feelings? No.

532
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,620
Where do they get you?

533
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:13,290
Good luck, good hunting, good friends.

534
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,198
Better luck next time.

535
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:16,330
I hope so.
