1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,802
He's French.

2
00:00:07,803 --> 00:00:09,790
He betrayed us to the Gestapo.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,044
Get me on a plane to nice as fast as you can.

4
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:14,480
Butcher is here.

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,760
Oh, it's so good to be together again.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,640
Boucher belongs to the four of us. Us?

7
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,848
Monsieur Roche, could you excuse me?

8
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:05,820
Just come.

9
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,978
Uncle Tommy, the man who left the ruby ring

10
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:15,524
when you were out this morning is here.

11
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:17,089
What time is it?

12
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,160
315.

13
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,404
Ready for at least an hour.

14
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:23,492
Tell him you deliver it to his hotel this evening. Wait.

15
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:24,400
I'll tell him.

16
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,690
Hey.

17
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:28,372
Why'd you say it'd be ready at three?

18
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:30,240
Anyway, I'm new here.

19
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,292
Tell Mr.

20
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:59,690
Boucher you'll deliver it by this evening.

21
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,590
But his name's Guillaume Roche.

22
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,858
Oh, yeah, that's you, Roche.

23
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:08,000
Are you all right?

24
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,980
Akil?

25
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,000
Three beers.

26
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,150
What's wrong?

27
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,990
Something's happened.

28
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,070
What is it?

29
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,610
What is it, Tommy?

30
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,372
This morning, a man who called himself Roche came

31
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:29,506
into my shop to have a ring repaired.

32
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:31,372
I was still working on it.

33
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:33,420
I saw him from the back of the shop.

34
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,530
It was Boucher.

35
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,960
Are you absolutely certain?

36
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:50,880
Certain.

37
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,008
Where is he?

38
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,900
He's at the west end Hotel for the next ten days.

39
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,630
Tommy.

40
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,790
Tommy.

41
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,900
How do you say thank God?

42
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:17,280
And I'm going to kill him in the same sentence.

43
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,450
1945 to 28 years, isn't it?

44
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,382
I prayed every night that someday may.

45
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,320
All hen.

46
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,830
I'm going to kill him now.

47
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,470
Wherever he is right now.

48
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,210
I don't care what happens then.

49
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,610
I want him to look the way Claude looked.

50
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,970
Boucher belongs to the four of us.

51
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,030
Claude was your friend.

52
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
He was my husband.

53
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:55,710
There's a difference.

54
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,390
Excuse me.

55
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,420
Problem? Yes.

56
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:14,130
Anything I can help you with?

57
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,150
No, thank you.

58
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,018
That's a beautiful thing.

59
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:20,630
What do you think we should offer?

60
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,576
Yes, Mr. Halliday?

61
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:28,218
Get me on a plane to Nice as

62
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:29,738
fast as you can, will you, please?

63
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:30,362
What?

64
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:31,684
Nice? It's in France.

65
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:32,852
First thing out of Kennedy.

66
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:33,645
Yes, sir.

67
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,381
What is that?

68
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:35,659
I don't understand.

69
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,438
I haven't got time to talk about it now.

70
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,000
I've got to pack some clothes.

71
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,124
Now you just wait a moment, Stephen.

72
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,090
You're not getting on any plane to nice

73
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,474
or anywhere else without an explanation to me.

74
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:49,234
Now, tell me, what's this all about?

75
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:51,522
I've worked here twelve years, right?

76
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:54,018
Neither of us have had anything to complain about.

77
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:55,238
Right now I've got to ask you

78
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:57,420
for an indefinite leave of absence.

79
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,396
I'm in a hurry.

80
00:08:58,397 --> 00:09:00,598
I don't care what kind of a hurry you're in.

81
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:03,410
I've never seen anything like this in my life.

82
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,746
Clyde.

83
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:26,378
I'm just going to get some coffee.

84
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,710
You got a telegram.

85
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,452
Where is it?

86
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:31,620
They phoned it in.

87
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:32,852
I was right out there in the shop.

88
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:33,988
Why didn't you call me?

89
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,040
You were working.

90
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,320
I wrote it down for you.

91
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,762
It's a joke telegram.

92
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:43,928
If it was important, I would have

93
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:45,320
given it to you right away.

94
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:46,766
It's just a joke.

95
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,518
It's signed, a leopard and elephant picket.

96
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,670
I tell you, the whole thing is a joke.

97
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,080
Butcher is here.

98
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,560
But I tell you, it's just somebody fooling around.

99
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,722
How do you think they look?

100
00:10:33,723 --> 00:10:34,608
Older.

101
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:45,370
Same as we're.

102
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,388
Alex.

103
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:59,560
Hey, Alex.

104
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,350
How are you?

105
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,802
Hey, who was the guy that said,

106
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:12,400
time moves inexperably on while standing still?

107
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:13,208
Nobody.

108
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:13,900
Nobody.

109
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,672
Good to see, Alex.

110
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:18,632
And you, Zulga.

111
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:20,030
Now, whoever called?

112
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,020
No idea.

113
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:25,440
Nazis, I suppose.

114
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,804
Bundak.

115
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:29,594
Remember the first night when we made up

116
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:32,298
the code name and how we laughed and

117
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:35,386
my Claude called you the elephant? Remember?

118
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:37,380
The elephant never forgets.

119
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,300
I'm going to cry when I see them.

120
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,040
I may join you.

121
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,800
Sam.

122
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:50,580
Sam.

123
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,150
Hey, come on.

124
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,666
Oh, my.

125
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,866
So good to be together again.

126
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:13,790
I'd say here, you'd all stand me up, wouldn't you?

127
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,750
Say it here. Here.

128
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,104
Well, got work to do. Emily.

129
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:23,490
Come on, let's go.

130
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,552
Ambrosia.

131
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:41,510
Smells more like buoyabays to me.

132
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,630
Same thing.

133
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,428
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

134
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:52,890
Just a little welcome.

135
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,880
Not too much salt juice.

136
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,564
Leave the fish to stew in our own juice.

137
00:12:58,565 --> 00:12:59,906
While we consider making Mr.

138
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:01,950
Boucher stew in his. Sure.

139
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,378
Oh, what do we know about him so far?

140
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:12,860
Well, not a great deal, I'm afraid.

141
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,560
He's at the West End Hotel for the next ten days.

142
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:22,568
He's got a silver Mercedes with Belgium license plates.

143
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,230
Number.

144
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:39,710
Anyway.

145
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,850
Where would Boucher get that kind of money?

146
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,758
Last time we saw him, he had

147
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,052
that little picture frame shop in Canada.

148
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:48,862
He was hardly flourishing on reward money

149
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:52,036
from the Nazis for betraying resistance fighters.

150
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:54,034
Wonder how much he got for us.

151
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:55,736
Quite a lot, I should imagine.

152
00:13:55,737 --> 00:13:57,554
It was three days after we'd stolen the

153
00:13:57,555 --> 00:14:00,194
German army payroll for the entire district, remember?

154
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:01,746
Oh, do I ever.

155
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:02,978
Now, that was really beautiful.

156
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:03,630
Yeah.

157
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,730
Anything else?

158
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,810
Yeah, I've done some drawings of them.

159
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,640
Last night he had dinner at the Carlton Can.

160
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:19,088
Then he went to the yacht club

161
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:21,184
at Cap Dawn Teab for a drink.

162
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:24,336
Backed the know just like a wealthy tourist.

163
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:26,390
He didn't get any prettier, did he?

164
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,210
Be nice to know where he got all that money.

165
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,680
Maybe married my ex wives.

166
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,320
Wish I felt like laughing.

167
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,460
I'm sorry, Manosh.

168
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,300
I guess we better find out more about, huh?

169
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,900
Hawaii.

170
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,018
What else do we want to know about him?

171
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,416
Except that he's French.

172
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:53,032
He betrayed us to the Gestapo.

173
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:54,640
Enough isn't.

174
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:55,426
Listen.

175
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,762
Listen now.

176
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,450
Listen to what they tortured everyone. Was.

177
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,974
They killed my husband right in front of

178
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:03,452
me with a child kicking in my belly.

179
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:05,114
So we don't have to know anything

180
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:07,066
more about Monsieur Bushy at all.

181
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:08,390
Except that he's here.

182
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,950
We waited for 28 years.

183
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,310
What I expect we'll do now together is kill him.

184
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,630
Am I right?

185
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,110
Are there any questions about it?

186
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,520
Ellie, Tommy.

187
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,196
Manush.

188
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:30,750
We're all here because is here.

189
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,136
We want revenge.

190
00:15:34,137 --> 00:15:36,940
For ourselves, for Claude, mostly.

191
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,160
We can kill him in some alley and never be caught.

192
00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:43,230
That's easy.

193
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,806
That's not exactly our style anymore, is it?

194
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:50,902
We killed more times than I can count, every one of us.

195
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:52,662
We killed German soldiers during a war

196
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:55,052
that's been over a long time. We're not murderers.

197
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:55,862
Aren't we?

198
00:15:55,863 --> 00:15:56,710
I am.

199
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,200
Every night I lie up there in bed and I kill Boucher.

200
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:04,378
So I should be overjoyed to

201
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,144
murder him in Sunbath Alley.

202
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:07,328
The hell was moralizing.

203
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:08,686
I want to do it now.

204
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:09,828
I'm not moralizing.

205
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:11,470
I want to kill him as much as you do.

206
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,040
He turned us into the Gestapo for profit.

207
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,080
But he's up to something else now, something ugly.

208
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,490
And whatever that is, maybe we can use it to get him.

209
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:24,856
And if we can't?

210
00:16:24,857 --> 00:16:26,008
Then you pull the trigger.

211
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:28,350
I promise you that. Okay.

212
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,998
I'll give you this.

213
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:34,530
We do have time.

214
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,998
All right.

215
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:38,838
Try it your way for now.

216
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:40,800
You gonna trust us? Manus.

217
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,700
Elku?

218
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:55,620
No, it's me, George.

219
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,482
Hey, he's a police sergeant now, isn't he?

220
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:00,506
He's a what?

221
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:01,584
Police sergeant.

222
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:02,672
He's made a lieutenant.

223
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,377
He's quite a captain. You like him?

224
00:17:04,378 --> 00:17:06,948
Well, that's what we need right now. A. No, he's safe.

225
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:07,582
He doesn't know anything.

226
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,220
He thinks it's a big reunion.

227
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:12,372
Yeah, and when that ruddy signal tower collapsed.

228
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:14,990
Oh, yeah, and the train went clear off the track.

229
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,031
This is George, Monsieur Devon.

230
00:17:23,032 --> 00:17:24,232
How are you, George?

231
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,480
This is Alec Malo.

232
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:26,263
Monsieur Marlowe.

233
00:17:26,264 --> 00:17:26,482
Hi.

234
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:27,528
The tiger.

235
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:29,670
My mother's told me much about you.

236
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:31,164
Last time I saw you, you weren't

237
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:33,046
more than three, four weeks old.

238
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:34,412
This is Stephen Halliday.

239
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:36,252
Monsieur Halliday, the fox.

240
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:37,212
Good to see you, George.

241
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:39,078
You took me to the zoo in Monaco and

242
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:41,680
told me all those marvellous stories about my father.

243
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:43,540
Well, he was quite a fellow.

244
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,042
Forgive me, I have to open the bar stand.

245
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:49,098
Have a glass of us.

246
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:51,002
I would like to, but I haven't much time.

247
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,104
I just came to pay my respects.

248
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:53,786
Come on.

249
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:55,024
Just a quick one, eh?

250
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:55,582
All right, then.

251
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,060
Just a quick one to your reunion.

252
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:00,996
Tell me what's been happening on the Riviera lately.

253
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,732
Beside drug pushing, murders, rapes and robberies.

254
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:06,568
Anything nasty is stealing 9 million francs

255
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:08,680
worth of paintings in four days nasty?

256
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:11,224
Oh, I don't know. Say it's Johnny.

257
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:12,594
Nice work if you can get it.

258
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:14,460
Well, you're not a policeman.

259
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,810
Look, have you seen this?

260
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,490
Oh, boy.

261
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,374
My heart goes out to the insurance companies.

262
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,988
The Chief inspector's heart goes out to nobody.

263
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:28,518
Do you know, this morning he called me into

264
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,110
his office and asked me to show him this.

265
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,610
And then he said, I just wanted to make sure

266
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:39,400
there is a lieutenant Georges in this police force.

267
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,242
Even your photograph looks inside.

268
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:42,858
Well, enough of my problems.

269
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,470
I'm honored to be here.

270
00:18:45,080 --> 00:19:18,790
Your healthy it.

271
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,260
Gorgeous.

272
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,670
All right.

273
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,140
Looking on the script.

274
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,770
You do this from memory, too?

275
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,300
Forgery? Yeah.

276
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:30,640
Have you forgotten?

277
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,140
Who am I going to be this time, Detective Sergeant?

278
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,720
You have to call me Alphonse.

279
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:40,820
You insist?

280
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,270
So I had to hit somebody.

281
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,454
The.

282
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:05,970
Only way I could get out of there.

283
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,470
No big deal.

284
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:10,214
Still enjoy it, don't you?

285
00:22:10,215 --> 00:22:11,250
I don't know.

286
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,654
Been a long time.

287
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:15,650
Boy, my hand hurts like crazy.

288
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,558
Poor thing.

289
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,736
I'll get you some ice.

290
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,032
Maybe I should soak it in brandy.

291
00:22:20,033 --> 00:22:21,962
I'll drink the brandy. Okay.

292
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:22,922
What do you got so far?

293
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:26,458
A bunch of packing crates with Smith labeled on them.

294
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:29,248
A chauffeur sitting outside making diagrams

295
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:30,938
or something of the house.

296
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:33,028
Well, Boucher's on the inside. Case in the joint.

297
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:34,174
Now, what's all that mean?

298
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:36,382
Sounds like he's in the breaking and entering business.

299
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:37,822
And believe me, he's doing all right.

300
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:38,910
You should see his car.

301
00:22:38,911 --> 00:22:41,502
Yeah, well, let's see what Tommy knows about.

302
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:44,104
207 Obi Nak, a 14 roomed

303
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:47,340
house, extensive gardens, swimming pool.

304
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,944
Formerly belonged to the Anton Juve estate.

305
00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:53,782
Was bought yesterday for just under

306
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:56,492
4 million francs by American investment

307
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:59,010
broker Calvin Smith of Boston, Mass.

308
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,878
On the matter with his memory, he just

309
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:03,868
quoted me an item from the niece. Mat sand.

310
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:04,982
Three months old.

311
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,228
Anyway, Smith's first name is Calvin.

312
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:08,326
Does that mean anything to you?

313
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:10,192
Ah, yeah, now that sounds familiar.

314
00:23:10,193 --> 00:23:11,920
Yeah, it should be familiar.

315
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:13,616
He's a millionaire art collector.

316
00:23:13,617 --> 00:23:17,568
He deals in little numbers like Titians and El Grecos.

317
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:18,848
Nothing cheap.

318
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:21,348
Maybe Boucher stealing paintings.

319
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:22,730
Possibly me.

320
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,094
Thank you.

321
00:23:28,095 --> 00:23:28,730
Thanks.

322
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,030
We ought to find out.

323
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,392
The police have been here four times already.

324
00:24:02,393 --> 00:24:03,822
I am exhausted.

325
00:24:03,823 --> 00:24:06,070
I have nothing else I can remember.

326
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,918
We do not wish to disturb you further.

327
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,408
We just wondered if you might have a look at these.

328
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:11,140
No.

329
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,736
Yes.

330
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:19,374
That's the one I saw in the mirror.

331
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,552
You're positive that's the man?

332
00:24:20,553 --> 00:24:21,490
I'm positive.

333
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,890
Thank you, madame. Depot?

334
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,208
What's she doing here?

335
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:07,216
I don't know.

336
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:09,008
I really just broke Jill in here.

337
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:10,830
I can't take her out now.

338
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:13,290
We need about half a minute.

339
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,980
Take care of it.

340
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:24,380
Have a look at this one, the little one under.

341
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,690
What's your definite.

342
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,664
George, how are you?

343
00:26:32,665 --> 00:26:34,264
How you say, tip top.

344
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:36,414
By the way, your mother's here with Stephen Halliday.

345
00:26:36,415 --> 00:26:39,110
Have you seen? No.

346
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:40,456
Oh, yes, yes.

347
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:43,448
Sunday culture for all. What are you doing here?

348
00:26:43,449 --> 00:26:46,696
You working or enjoying the art? Both.

349
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:48,104
But I'm watching the people more

350
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:49,346
than looking at the paintings.

351
00:26:49,347 --> 00:26:50,668
Now, you don't think you're going to pick

352
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:52,604
up your art thief in here, do you?

353
00:26:52,605 --> 00:26:55,590
We don't know very much about him, but who knows?

354
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:57,530
I could catch a. Huh?

355
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,720
There's some fantastic Van Dyke's over there.

356
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:01,056
Yes.

357
00:27:01,057 --> 00:27:02,566
The marvelous Sundays.

358
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,678
Jill, this is Georges. Roger.

359
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,174
George, this is Burton.

360
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:07,872
Hello.

361
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:08,768
Hello.

362
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:11,444
Cheap foreign labour for my shop, you understand?

363
00:27:11,445 --> 00:27:13,146
You told me I was being overpaid.

364
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:16,602
Well, you are, my darling. You are. George. Jules.

365
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:18,692
Only been on the Riviera for about two weeks.

366
00:27:18,693 --> 00:27:20,612
You're not too tied up at the moment.

367
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:22,632
Would you like to show her around?

368
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:24,710
I should be enchanted.

369
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:25,864
She doesn't speak a word of

370
00:27:25,865 --> 00:27:27,400
French, so have a good time.

371
00:27:27,401 --> 00:27:29,410
He's a policeman living quite safe.

372
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,680
Okay.

373
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,524
How did you manage that?

374
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:40,520
I think it managed itself.

375
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,580
This is where we'll do it.

376
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,740
You can't see the Rembrandt from here.

377
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,540
Remember that?

378
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,610
Late Tuesday afternoon.

379
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,500
Sooner than.

380
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,380
What a lovely day.

381
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,110
Just to see him walking.

382
00:28:52,111 --> 00:28:53,344
That face.

383
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:55,984
Maloosh, if we lose him.

384
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:58,688
No, we won't lose him.

385
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:00,090
That's a guarantee.

386
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,020
You.

387
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,672
Okay?

388
00:29:28,673 --> 00:29:29,840
Oh, I think so.

389
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:31,020
Let's have a look.

390
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,080
Fine.

391
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:34,784
All right.

392
00:29:34,785 --> 00:29:36,166
How's that coming, Tommy?

393
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,370
Nearly finished.

394
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,664
Okay.

395
00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:44,490
I'm going to need four of these for about 6 seconds.

396
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,220
Have to be.

397
00:29:53,110 --> 00:30:18,620
Don't Sa.

398
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,102
Where'd you get this? Heath.

399
00:31:22,103 --> 00:31:22,880
Should you like it.

400
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,230
I didn't notice the name of the street.

401
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:27,020
Okay, Mark.

402
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,206
Good luck, folks.

403
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:30,540
I just drank to that.

404
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,300
It.

405
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,680
You know there's a pickpocket here.

406
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:51,630
That's it.

407
00:34:40,880 --> 00:35:07,110
It's, um.

408
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,384
I've heard a hundred stories about the Zoo gang.

409
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:15,914
Oh, told you.

410
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:18,042
200 at the very least.

411
00:35:18,043 --> 00:35:19,738
You know the one about the time she was

412
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:21,748
at the Arms depot, gotten up as a nun.

413
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:23,500
Where was that, Leon?

414
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:26,484
And she tripped the alarm system with a crucifix.

415
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:27,758
I was thinking about the one when

416
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,068
you made smoke bombs in cigarette packets.

417
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:30,532
Smoke.

418
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:32,440
Smoke bombs in cigarettes.

419
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,330
Was it all?

420
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,328
I'm at the Negresco.

421
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:41,352
He's in the restaurant.

422
00:35:41,353 --> 00:35:42,728
They're just starting lunch.

423
00:35:42,729 --> 00:35:45,090
55049 here.

424
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,102
So?

425
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,850
Sorry, wrong number.

426
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,082
I want to know why you took it and where you put it.

427
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:06,666
Well, actually, we took it to save somebody's life.

428
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:07,994
What's that supposed to mean?

429
00:36:07,995 --> 00:36:10,202
Well, I can't tell you that, but I can tell you this.

430
00:36:10,203 --> 00:36:11,834
The painting will be put back.

431
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:13,838
What I can't understand is that you can

432
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,502
admit to this crime and then expect me,

433
00:36:15,503 --> 00:36:17,470
a police officer, to say nothing about it.

434
00:36:17,471 --> 00:36:20,700
That's exactly what we expect you to do, George.

435
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:22,578
We have a reason why we

436
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:24,242
got together after all these years.

437
00:36:24,243 --> 00:36:27,138
A reason which you would honor, and for which

438
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:31,538
I'm willing to die, if necessary, as my son.

439
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:35,414
And now I'M really taking unfair advantage of you.

440
00:36:35,415 --> 00:36:38,678
I must ask you to let us do what we think is right.

441
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:41,436
Now, if we fail, the painting will still be safe.

442
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:43,570
So please trust us.

443
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,640
Trust me.

444
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,800
You're too old for all this.

445
00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:18,336
You're too younger.

446
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:18,990
It.

447
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,458
The green one.

448
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:36,008
Keys.

449
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:37,150
And all this time.

450
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,840
Mrs. Smith.

451
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:21,400
Excuse me.

452
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:22,630
Teleport for.

453
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,702
Hello, Smith here.

454
00:38:37,703 --> 00:38:40,300
This is Inspector Delacroix, the pseudote.

455
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:44,944
I hope I have not disturbed your lunch.

456
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:46,630
No, not at all.

457
00:38:47,400 --> 00:39:04,218
Waiter Smith, take it.

458
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:04,910
It.

459
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,290
It looks like it's working.

460
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,612
Parbon, monsieur?

461
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,516
But the gentleman wishes to apologize.

462
00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:11,166
But suddenly he's not feeling very well.

463
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,810
He will telephone in a moment.

464
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,704
He took the bait, is on his way now.

465
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:31,720
Let's keep him waiting about 15 minutes.

466
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:36,840
Steve, I'm beginning to enjoy this myself.

467
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,450
We're lucky so far.

468
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:49,840
We always were.

469
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,160
Except once.

470
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:56,362
If this goes wrong, Steve, your promise still holds.

471
00:40:56,363 --> 00:40:57,370
Good.

472
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,630
Is all yours.

473
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,298
Mr. Smith.

474
00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:52,396
That's right.

475
00:42:52,397 --> 00:42:55,530
You are going to see your painting. Now.

476
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,140
You will do exactly as you are told.

477
00:42:58,141 --> 00:43:00,114
You will not be hurt.

478
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:03,692
We are interested only in the money.

479
00:43:03,693 --> 00:43:05,050
You understand?

480
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:06,240
Yes. It.

481
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,880
Walk to the door.

482
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,010
Stand still.

483
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,122
We'll put the lights on now, Mr.

484
00:44:03,123 --> 00:44:04,712
Smith, so that you can satisfy

485
00:44:04,713 --> 00:44:06,476
yourself that we have the Rembrandt.

486
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,798
Then you'll go home and make

487
00:44:07,799 --> 00:44:09,398
your arrangements for getting the money.

488
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:10,614
Then stay there till you

489
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:12,022
get further instructions from us.

490
00:44:12,023 --> 00:44:14,690
And don't talk to the police. Okay?

491
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,400
Lights.

492
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:40,800
Urge your hands, please, and keep quite still.

493
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,110
And so the how it goes.

494
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,390
Open your eyes, monsieur.

495
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:41,788
Help me.

496
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:42,950
Mr. Boucher.

497
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:47,190
And this is for Claude.

498
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:37,188
Race.

499
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:38,012
Now, Boucher.

500
00:47:38,013 --> 00:47:40,370
And after that, you're going to prison for a while.

501
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,908
I hope you have the good luck

502
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:44,182
to die while you're in there.

503
00:47:44,183 --> 00:47:45,718
Because if you don't, we're going to be

504
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:47,650
waiting for you when you come out.

505
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,950
How am I supposed to explain it?

506
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,820
I mean, the museum alone.

507
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,740
It's impossible.

508
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,380
How did you feel when you saw Boucher?

509
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,410
Yes, tell me.

510
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:12,880
All right, we'll try.

511
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,880
I think that's gon super.

512
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,528
I was just going to say, we must

513
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:22,050
think up some believable story for George.

514
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:24,408
I think this may interest you.

515
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:26,078
Three insurance companies are offering

516
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,934
rewards for these paintings.

517
00:48:27,935 --> 00:48:31,048
If the Surite believes our story, then

518
00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:32,760
I suppose the money goes to you.

519
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,650
960,000 francs.

520
00:48:38,651 --> 00:48:40,200
$200,000.

521
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:43,000
Well, that's super.

522
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,220
What a marvelous day.

523
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,752
A day to remember.

524
00:48:54,753 --> 00:48:57,470
Yesterday was a day to remember, too.

525
00:48:57,471 --> 00:48:59,508
Well, now that it's all over, I have to

526
00:48:59,509 --> 00:49:03,570
admit it's a bit better than washing wine glasses.

527
00:49:03,571 --> 00:49:06,106
Do you ever try changing fan belts?

528
00:49:06,107 --> 00:49:08,400
I haven't enjoyed anything that much in years.

529
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:11,140
It's almost like it used to be, wasn't it?

530
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:15,496
Except we never used to get 960,000 francs. Right.

531
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:18,728
Listen, I've been thinking about that money.

532
00:49:18,729 --> 00:49:20,792
What do you think we ought to do with it?

533
00:49:20,793 --> 00:49:22,408
Thought maybe we could use it

534
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:24,718
to build something for Claude.

535
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:25,800
Like what?

536
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,012
Something people here can use.

537
00:49:28,013 --> 00:49:29,436
People who've never heard of them, you know?

538
00:49:29,437 --> 00:49:30,764
What sort of thing?

539
00:49:30,765 --> 00:49:32,226
Maybe a ward in a hospital,

540
00:49:32,227 --> 00:49:34,040
a kid's ward, something like that.

541
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:36,200
What a great idea.

542
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,466
Hey, that'd take a lot of bread.

543
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:39,808
Well, a couple more jobs like this.

544
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:41,366
When you build a whole hospital.

545
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:42,784
You mean you're going to stay?

546
00:49:42,785 --> 00:49:44,912
I can think of a lot worse place to stay.

547
00:49:44,913 --> 00:49:47,808
The food's nice and the weather's good, and I guess

548
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:49,168
I can put up with you guys for a while.

549
00:49:49,169 --> 00:49:50,000
Sure, why not?

550
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:51,844
I don't have any ties either.

551
00:49:51,845 --> 00:49:53,892
I can sell antiques any place. Yeah?

552
00:49:53,893 --> 00:49:55,034
How about a few antique cars?

553
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:56,026
Might need fixing.

Well, we're all in love with you. So that even.
