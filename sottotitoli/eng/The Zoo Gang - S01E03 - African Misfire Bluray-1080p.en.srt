1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,790
Place will be guarded like Fort Knox.

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,150
Mr. Holiday.

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,350
Jacques.

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,030
They used to call him the Mad colonel in Algeria.

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:02:06,120
None of you could handle it.

6
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:50,588
There's San Diego.

7
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:52,290
Hey, that's cool.

8
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,890
And Kellis?

9
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:57,230
General Naganda calls it a crime against humanity.

10
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,850
He's offered a reward.

11
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:00,964
How much?

12
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,000
50,000.

13
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,930
Oh, we aim a little higher than that, don't we?

14
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:08,020
More than the money.

15
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:11,544
It's the principal, wouldn't you say? Yes.

16
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,240
Good deeds in a wicked world.

17
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:15,576
That's us, Tommy, isn't it? Oh, why not?

18
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:18,766
Here's General Naganda, deposed by coup d'etat.

19
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:21,586
He's got floods in his country and a typhoid epidemic.

20
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:23,228
He donates his art collection to

21
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,420
raise relief funds, and somebody hijacks. Sure.

22
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:26,684
What more do we need?

23
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:28,546
Well, that takes care of our motive.

24
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:29,468
What does that mean?

25
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:33,030
It's been unusually law abiding on the Riviera of late.

26
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:35,062
The quiet life's a ball.

27
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:37,792
That is our reason. Okay. What do you want it?

28
00:06:37,793 --> 00:06:38,134
A mission.

29
00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:39,350
We're just in it for kicks.

30
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:41,094
Well, it fits us better than the halo.

31
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:44,214
And if the flood victims benefit, it's a bonus.

32
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:45,140
What do we got?

33
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:47,060
Well, precious little at the moment.

34
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:49,546
Security van that disappears in broad daylight.

35
00:06:49,547 --> 00:06:51,492
Yeah, and the driver and the guard were

36
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:53,322
dumped out of a car near Monterou.

37
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:55,482
They weren't hurt, but they can't give any leads.

38
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,278
Police seem to think Nicole.

39
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,142
But somebody had to know the scourge of that van.

40
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:01,192
They had to.

41
00:07:01,193 --> 00:07:02,408
One man knew it.

42
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:03,540
One more, please.

43
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,328
Just one more.

44
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:07,660
General Nagando, please.

45
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,610
Any further statement, General?

46
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:11,628
My every effort will be devoted to

47
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:14,242
solving this shabby and despicable crime.

48
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:16,108
Aren't you concerned, General, that you might

49
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:17,890
be accused of playing in a pool

50
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:19,794
while your people are homeless and dying?

51
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:21,392
My people know I've tried to

52
00:07:21,393 --> 00:07:23,696
help, and I'll go on trying.

53
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:25,958
Denying myself a morning swim won't

54
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,318
bring the thieves to heal.

55
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,176
If it would, then I shouldn't be diving in.

56
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:32,240
I should be walking on the water.

57
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,962
Thank you, gentlemen.

58
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:43,864
You heard the general. We'll be in touch the

59
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:45,380
moment there's anything to report.

60
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,782
General, this is Mr. Holliday.

61
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,178
He's an art dealer.

62
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:07,204
I thought I might be able to help, General.

63
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:09,284
We've got half the detective force of

64
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:12,506
the AlpmaRI team working on it, Mr. Holiday.

65
00:08:12,507 --> 00:08:13,966
Are you smarter?

66
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:17,160
No, but I'm in the right business. Sorry.

67
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:19,590
It's been about 24 hours.

68
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:20,638
Understandable.

69
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,678
That was a lifetime's collection, Mr. Holiday.

70
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:27,422
Well, if your collection is still on the Riviera, the thieves

71
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,388
are liable to try to sell one or two things and

72
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:32,844
if they do, I'm more likely here by it. How?

73
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,658
Because I know the five or six dealers

74
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,604
on the coast they'd try to go to.

75
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:38,524
But supposing the thieves are on the

76
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:41,778
coast, why not Paris or Amsterdam?

77
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,424
Oh, well, in that case, I think that it

78
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:45,568
tried to hijack it further north of here.

79
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:47,504
Why would they wait to get this close to Nice and

80
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:49,790
then have to head all the way back across Europe?

81
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,560
Help yourself, Mr. Holliday. Thank you.

82
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,448
Mineral water for me.

83
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:04,580
Alcohol makes me fat. Thanks.

84
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,390
Now, these dealers the police are checking already?

85
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:11,864
Well, the ones I mean don't cooperate with the law.

86
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:13,192
Why would they cooperate with you?

87
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:14,408
For the reward money.

88
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:15,996
And you take a percentage. What?

89
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:17,480
Everybody has to make a living.

90
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,804
Now, if you want me to try this, I've got

91
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:21,990
to have a detailed list of the whole collection.

92
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,430
Thank you.

93
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,136
Nice place, huh?

94
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,260
Oh, Dandy.

95
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,502
I guess you're thinking Tom Binaganda lives

96
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:39,540
high, even if he is in exile.

97
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,702
Well, that's the compensations of office, General.

98
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:46,460
That's what my enemies at home say, only not so polite.

99
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,826
It's true.

100
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:50,018
When that bunch of opportunist thugs pulled their

101
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:51,378
coup and threw me out in the name

102
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:53,858
of democracy, I wasn't a proper.

103
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,122
But I trade all this to get my art collection back.

104
00:09:57,123 --> 00:09:58,230
And not for me.

105
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,798
For the people who lost their homes in

106
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,198
the flood, who are sick and dying from

107
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:06,508
typhoid because I still care about them. End of speech.

108
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:06,742
Mr.

109
00:10:06,743 --> 00:10:12,090
Halliday, you covered by insurance for $200,000.

110
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,186
The true value you've read in the paper.

111
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:17,642
A million at a charity gala with all the top

112
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:20,570
people trying to prove how rich and generous they are.

113
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:22,308
That's what we expected to raise.

114
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:23,310
I guess you would.

115
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:24,462
No doubt of it.

116
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:25,748
To the rich.

117
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:27,662
Generosity not only makes them feel

118
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:30,040
good, it's also tax deductible.

119
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,212
Now, who else knew about the schedule?

120
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:35,560
That security van?

121
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,424
Only Chombotti, genErally.

122
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:41,360
I assure you, he assures me he's loyal.

123
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:43,698
And I assure you, I believe him.

124
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,140
Nobody else?

125
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:46,966
The insurance company.

126
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:48,972
Mediterranean Life and Accident.

127
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:50,038
Paris office?

128
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,092
No, local branch. Mr. Ferrand. Ferrand?

129
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:56,070
He's been with the office 20 years.

130
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:57,702
Stick to your shady dealers, Mr.

131
00:10:57,703 --> 00:11:00,058
Holiday, and thanks for trying to help, even

132
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,260
if it is on a strictly cash basis.

133
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,362
Excuse me.

134
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:26,498
Lucifer is here to see you.

135
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:27,800
Thank you, Khaled.

136
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:35,986
Ask him to come about the figures on my policy.

137
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,954
I must have been mad when I agreed to help.

138
00:11:37,955 --> 00:11:39,382
Look what you have stirred up.

139
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:41,030
The police have already been here.

140
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:44,236
Naturally, it's houting, but you are quite safe.

141
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,130
You were here at the office at the time.

142
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,440
So I promise you, keep your nerves. Jewelry.

143
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,048
Thank you for the quote.

144
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,230
I will take it over and let you know.

145
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,870
Just there. Just there. That's fine.

146
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,290
Relax now. Big smile. Big smile. Five.

147
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,138
This is a very old dodge, but it might just work.

148
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,626
If either one of them's got anything

149
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:22,430
to hide, your next appointment is here.

150
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,840
Thank you.

151
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,260
Miss Uferran?

152
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,740
Alec Marlowe.

153
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:52,222
I called you yesterday about

154
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:54,140
automobile and truck insurance.

155
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:55,396
Marlowe?

156
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:59,346
Yeah, I'm not insured with Mediterranean, but my people

157
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:01,778
keep bumping the premiums up, so I thought maybe

158
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:04,386
you could give me a better deal. Yes, Mr.

159
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:05,890
Marrow, of course.

160
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:09,260
I shall be most happy to prepare a quotation.

161
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,416
Faro.

162
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,546
Well, maybe.

163
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:15,272
Alex says the photograph certainly threw him. Alex?

164
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:16,246
Keep an eye on him.

165
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:17,452
What about Chombote?

166
00:14:17,453 --> 00:14:18,668
Well, I was in the hotel

167
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:20,300
lobby when he collected his mail.

168
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:23,548
He just opened the letter and looked puzzled.

169
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:25,514
I kind of think he's loyal to the general.

170
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:27,946
Magunda made quite an impression on you, didn't he?

171
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:29,792
Oh, he's tough as an old rope.

172
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:31,162
Seems pretty sincere, too.

173
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,544
And he's a politician.

174
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:33,610
You never know.

175
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,444
There's somebody to see you, madam. Thank you, Eckhart.

176
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:42,250
In a moment.

177
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,086
Anything else?

178
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,312
We'll work on Fran.

179
00:14:46,313 --> 00:14:48,110
I'll call you from case of eight.

180
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,260
He's over there. My daughter.

181
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,034
Jacques, is it possible.

182
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,726
Honey, how are you?

183
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,004
But you look absolutely enchanting.

184
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:12,012
Nothing has changed.

185
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:13,490
Well, it's been seven years.

186
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,128
You still have your jewelry shop. Still there, Colonel?

187
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:19,776
Oh, no longer, Colonel. I have retired.

188
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:21,168
It became unfashionable.

189
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,712
And this is Stephen Halliday. Jacques Picard.

190
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:24,864
I miss you, Halliday.

191
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:25,962
Stephen is from New York

192
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:29,422
and Jacques is from everywhere. Oh, in the past.

193
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:30,708
Sherry, I am a civilian.

194
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:31,662
I have rent to the house.

195
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:33,678
I am going to settle down. You?

196
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,278
Well, in the past, you always said that

197
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,190
I should, but I never really believed you.

198
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:39,570
I think we leave you to it.

199
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,632
Goodbye, Picard.

200
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:41,768
Gentlemen.

201
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:44,914
Why, I have only been back for a few days,

202
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:47,282
but I have been thinking of you every moment.

203
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:50,210
You always knew how to say the right thing, didn't you?

204
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,084
Picard?

205
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:56,988
Charm, Incorporated.

206
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,390
Where is he, anyway?

207
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:01,564
They used to call him the Mad colonel in Algeria.

208
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:03,754
He was some sort of hero there.

209
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,312
Then there were other places.

210
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:07,480
Arabia, Congo.

211
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:10,176
And then he finally ran out of wars.

212
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,750
Mercenary, is he?

213
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,514
Well, he used to say he

214
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,830
fought for causes, not for money.

215
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,500
Women found that romantic, Manus.

216
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,890
Well, that's not our business.

217
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:41,546
Let's go lean on Ferrand it again.

218
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:43,808
The robbery is going to cost you 100,000 francs.

219
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:46,970
If we go to the police. Who is this? Who is speaking?

220
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,122
Never mind who it is.

221
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:49,338
Just go to the bank, get the

222
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:50,870
money, and I'll call you back.

223
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:42,510
It sa.

224
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,034
Well, let's check the garage, and I'll

225
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:43,070
go around the rest of the household.

226
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,240
It.

227
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,296
I knew I had missed you, but until

228
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:28,340
now I did not realize how much.

229
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,212
Jacques, where did you go

230
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:33,282
after Leopardsville and Zambia?

231
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:34,946
Unimportant places.

232
00:21:34,947 --> 00:21:39,116
Weren't you in Bawella, General Naganda's country?

233
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:39,964
Ex country.

234
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,532
Yes, briefly. What?

235
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,260
He liked the general.

236
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,854
Unlucky.

237
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:46,256
First he loses his country,

238
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:47,286
and then his art collection.

239
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:50,310
Oh, I think it's despicable. What? Robbery.

240
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:53,526
It's just like picking an old lady's pocket.

241
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:54,848
I'm not sure the general would like

242
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:55,958
to be called an old lady.

243
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:58,042
No, but it's the flood victims that suffer.

244
00:21:58,043 --> 00:22:00,516
Doesn't that bother you at all? Of course.

245
00:22:00,517 --> 00:22:02,666
Oh, but don't let spoil a lovely afternoon.

246
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,116
It is a police matter.

247
00:22:04,117 --> 00:22:06,110
It is no concern of ours.

248
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,390
What's eating you, Steve?

249
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,906
Listen, forget about Naganda's hotel.

250
00:22:18,907 --> 00:22:20,420
Let's go to Manousa's place.

251
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:46,692
Okay, wait for it.

252
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:48,170
Better call the police.

253
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:50,228
Not until we told Manoush. What do you want to do?

254
00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:51,680
Give him a chance to get away.

255
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,240
How do you think she's going to feel?

256
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,030
Rotten.

257
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,520
I was just got back.

258
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,784
You have news. What is it?

259
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:20,656
You found it, haven't you?

260
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:23,370
Yeah, we found it in the house up above Antib.

261
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,038
Marvelous.

262
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,290
And the thieves?

263
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,776
Wasn't anybody there.

264
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:31,792
But we know who it is.

265
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:34,380
There'll be enough fingerprints around to nail him.

266
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,710
Have you called the police?

267
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:39,790
No, not yet.

268
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:40,940
What is it?

269
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,650
Jacques Tica.

270
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,338
Where did you find this?

271
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:57,760
In the house.

272
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:59,762
Is this the only proof? So far.

273
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:01,470
I really fingerprint the place.

274
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,978
It's got to be a. No.

275
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,160
No, there isn't.

276
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,900
All right, I'll get the stuff back to Naganda.

277
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:12,850
Alec and.

278
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,530
No, wait.

279
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,140
At least let's give him a chance to explain.

280
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:22,230
Now, what's that?

281
00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:24,458
Special pleading for an old friend. Cut it out. See?

282
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:26,378
It was a bloody stupid thing to say. It is.

283
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:28,360
It is special pleading.

284
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:30,346
But I've known him for a long time.

285
00:24:30,347 --> 00:24:34,840
Maybe I'm a fool, but there could be some explanation.

286
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,366
Mr.

287
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:41,924
Holliday, you're a magician.

288
00:24:41,925 --> 00:24:44,542
You have quite remarkable sources of information.

289
00:24:44,543 --> 00:24:45,748
No, we get lucky.

290
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:47,454
I think you'll find it all there.

291
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:48,750
I'm sure.

292
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:49,960
But you're too modest.

293
00:24:49,961 --> 00:24:51,138
How did you do it?

294
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:53,762
Oh, one dealer hears a rumor and he

295
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:55,522
tells another one, and it goes on.

296
00:24:55,523 --> 00:24:56,578
You know how it goes.

297
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,686
I don't, but I do. Get the message?

298
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:03,164
No questions, no publicity. Pity.

299
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:05,244
We'll look good together on the front pages.

300
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:06,716
What matters is the charity.

301
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:08,444
Gallagher can go ahead as planned.

302
00:25:08,445 --> 00:25:10,134
Two nights from now, they'll raise enough to

303
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,278
build new homes and fly in all the

304
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,170
food and medicine to our country.

305
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:16,208
That's my reward, Mr. Holliday.

306
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:17,520
Here's yours.

307
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:20,586
I dare say I should write this out to cash. No.

308
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:21,674
The dealers and I would like

309
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:23,348
to be represented in the airlift.

310
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:25,486
So just make it out to the relief fund.

311
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:27,556
You're full of surprises, Mr. Holliday.

312
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:28,760
It would be a pleasure.

313
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,342
Madam's in the back room.

314
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,150
She said to go through. Thank you.

315
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,770
Manous. Here I am.

316
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:44,220
Close the door, Jack.

317
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,090
Aren't you ready? Sit down.

318
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,050
Sit down.

319
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,270
What's wrong?

320
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,434
This morning my friends went to

321
00:26:05,435 --> 00:26:08,100
the Villaturin in the Roy Fontanel.

322
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,820
There they found a laundry truck.

323
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,690
I think you ought to tell me how it got there.

324
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,680
YOu took the Naganda collection.

325
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,420
You are a thief.

326
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,738
I defended you.

327
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:31,240
I said it's impossible.

328
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:32,744
What happened to the collection?

329
00:26:32,745 --> 00:26:33,752
It's been returned.

330
00:26:33,753 --> 00:26:35,960
Don't you worry about that. Wait a minute.

331
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,112
Return to Naganda?

332
00:26:37,113 --> 00:26:38,872
To the general, naturally.

333
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:40,160
The fools.

334
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,974
You know what your gullible friends have done.

335
00:26:43,975 --> 00:26:46,326
At the moment, we're concerned about what you have.

336
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:48,310
They have played right into the gander's hands.

337
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:50,400
They've helped to finance a bloodbath.

338
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,770
What are you talking about?

339
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,706
Just listen to me.

340
00:26:55,707 --> 00:26:57,498
And then if you do not believe me,

341
00:26:57,499 --> 00:27:00,040
you can hand me over to the police.

342
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:04,154
Yes, I stole the collection and I will tell you why.

343
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,212
To stop it being auctioned at the gala.

344
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:08,462
Because the million dollars they will raise is

345
00:27:08,463 --> 00:27:10,436
not going to be used for flood victims.

346
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:12,804
It is not for food or drugs.

347
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:15,720
It's to pay an army of trained mercenaries.

348
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,772
Laganda already has guns and ammunition.

349
00:27:18,773 --> 00:27:20,008
The men are recruited.

350
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:21,586
When he pays them, they will fly in.

351
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:23,032
His chief minister, Jambodi.

352
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:24,354
He tried to recruit me.

353
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:25,522
They are going to use this

354
00:27:25,523 --> 00:27:27,986
emergency to overthrow a democratic government.

355
00:27:27,987 --> 00:27:30,160
Naganda will crash it.

356
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:32,370
Can you prove any of this?

357
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:34,406
No more than I can prove that he is Powell. Crazy.

358
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:35,878
But remember Manush? I was there.

359
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:37,590
I knew him when he started.

360
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:39,414
Yes, he was benevolent, a good man.

361
00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:41,148
But it's the old story, pal.

362
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:43,190
Corrupted him, so they threw him out.

363
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,430
Well, it's quite a story.

364
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,520
Why didn't you take it to the newspapers?

365
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:50,506
Because like you, Mr.

366
00:27:50,507 --> 00:27:52,426
Devon, they wouldn't believe me. Thanks.

367
00:27:52,427 --> 00:27:54,154
And swallowing that, you hijacked the

368
00:27:54,155 --> 00:27:55,966
Negounder collection for the public good.

369
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:57,720
Well, it was not for my benefit.

370
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,500
Manous knows I am not a thief.

371
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:01,566
You can't prove it.

372
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:04,206
Well, give him a chance.

373
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:06,052
There is a man called Jules Ferrachan.

374
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:07,044
I did not want to involve

375
00:28:07,045 --> 00:28:08,562
him because it could ruin him.

376
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:10,936
He gave me the schedule of the security van.

377
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:13,442
Unlike your friends, he believed me.

378
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:15,048
In his office is an envelope

379
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:17,186
which I gave him this morning. What's in it?

380
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:19,416
The keys to the garage and the keys to the truck.

381
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:21,058
My agreement with Ferrand was that he

382
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,508
should keep them until it was safe

383
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:24,332
to give the collection back to Noganda.

384
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,526
When's that supposed to be?

385
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:27,158
When the emergency was over.

386
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:29,718
He could no longer use the situation

387
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:31,610
to raise the money he needs.

388
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:34,432
We could ask Ferran.

389
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:35,850
That wouldn't prove anything either.

390
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:39,424
Well, to prove at least a reasonable doubt.

391
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:40,720
Not to me, it wouldn't.

392
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:43,034
Because you don't want to believe him.

393
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:44,846
No, because it's too pat.

394
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:46,468
Bad dictator, good colonel.

395
00:28:46,469 --> 00:28:48,798
Mercenaries, guns and ammunition, all that.

396
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,350
Where are the guns, anyway?

397
00:28:50,351 --> 00:28:52,974
I don't know where?

398
00:28:52,975 --> 00:28:54,286
Somewhere I could not find them.

399
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:55,972
They got nothing. I accept.

400
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:57,580
Perhaps the troops.

401
00:28:57,581 --> 00:29:00,004
It's something which I heard in my thought tonight.

402
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,218
Perhaps we'll finish up.

403
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:04,098
Like everything else which I've tried, we'll find out.

404
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:05,624
It could be dangerous.

405
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:07,644
Could also prove that you have unleashed

406
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,600
something which none of you could handle.

407
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,242
This property isn't in any

408
00:29:41,243 --> 00:29:43,220
government list I've seen published.

409
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,370
High voltage.

410
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,586
Look, we're not going to find anything.

411
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:14,218
Maybe you should stay here.

412
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:15,482
Well, if we're not going to find

413
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:17,210
anything, there's no danger, is there?

414
00:30:17,211 --> 00:30:18,490
Go right on.

415
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,170
All right, where's your army?

416
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,468
I will take a look. We'll go with.

417
00:30:35,469 --> 00:32:13,120
You're just one for luck, Major.

418
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:14,614
You get one for luck.

419
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:15,660
Form up.

420
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,620
Very impressive, Major.

421
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:25,172
Just games to test the equipment and to keep

422
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:30,314
the men from getting restless waiting for payday.

423
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,420
You can assure them there's no longer any problems.

424
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:34,894
The money will be available the day after tomorrow.

425
00:32:34,895 --> 00:32:38,180
Enough to pay every officer and another 300 men.

426
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,488
Tell the general we should be

427
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:43,970
ready to fly in as planned.

428
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,130
Lieutenant. Roger.

429
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,498
I have information that armed

430
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:35,960
men are being trained here.

431
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,108
Armed men?

432
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:40,200
Somebody must be playing a joke on you.

433
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,120
Hey, Francois, have you seen any

434
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,100
men with guns round here?

435
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,184
I have also been told that you have a

436
00:33:51,185 --> 00:33:52,784
large wooden shed with bullet holes in it.

437
00:33:52,785 --> 00:33:53,980
I would like to see it.

438
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,930
What wooden shed?

439
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,526
Well, as you can see, Inspector, there is

440
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:11,360
no wooden shed, with or without bullet holes.

441
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,358
They must have spotted us. I doubt it.

442
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:19,898
This has been the pattern since I

443
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:21,552
first started to look for proof.

444
00:34:21,553 --> 00:34:23,737
The Gandha can't risk leaving the mercenaries in

445
00:34:23,738 --> 00:34:25,706
one place for any length of time.

446
00:34:25,707 --> 00:34:28,570
Well, 50 men expect 300 more.

447
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:30,447
WheRe are they? Are they guests?

448
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:32,292
In small hotels up and down the coast.

449
00:34:32,293 --> 00:34:34,467
With papers to prove that they are genuine. Tourists.

450
00:34:34,468 --> 00:34:36,532
You said he'd already bought the arms.

451
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,956
They must be stored somewhere.

452
00:34:37,957 --> 00:34:39,694
You need the entire police force to

453
00:34:39,695 --> 00:34:41,636
cover the warehouses between here and Marseille.

454
00:34:41,637 --> 00:34:42,833
Well, after today, we're not going

455
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:44,232
to have any police force.

456
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:45,496
George is furious.

457
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:48,080
The gambler must be laughing his head off.

458
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,081
Merceries wouldn't fight without being paid.

459
00:34:50,082 --> 00:34:51,650
Now they're going to be paid.

460
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:53,436
Unless we do what you intended.

461
00:34:53,437 --> 00:34:54,828
Well, steal the collection.

462
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:56,966
We haven't got a chance. No.

463
00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:58,838
The money they get when they sell it at the

464
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:07,232
charity auction place will be guarded like Fort Knox.

465
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:08,634
But the checks and the money have to

466
00:35:08,635 --> 00:35:10,816
be taken to the bank after the auction.

467
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,660
That means a bank messenger.

468
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,278
We also have to distract the

469
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:21,240
guards for about 30 seconds.

470
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,606
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, our

471
00:35:30,607 --> 00:35:32,880
auctioneer would like your attention.

472
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,738
He has promised to do his best to

473
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:37,474
lighten your wallets and your bank accounts in

474
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:39,528
the best of all possible causes.

475
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:42,776
May I thank you for your attendance and generosity?

476
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:44,050
For a worthy cause.

477
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,730
And you can fool most of the people most of the time.

478
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,342
Darling, what are you doing here?

479
00:35:54,343 --> 00:35:55,302
Wouldn't you know it?

480
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:57,356
Escorted to the gala and abandoned.

481
00:35:57,357 --> 00:35:59,318
My date's in charge of security.

482
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:00,848
George is in charge.

483
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:02,010
He didn't tell me.

484
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:04,180
They didn't tell him until this afternoon.

485
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,088
Well, I'm going to circulate.

486
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:08,740
I might pick up a print.

487
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,050
Lot number one.

488
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,926
George will be in the soup again.

489
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:16,318
Think we should call it off?

490
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:18,542
No, must go ahead.

491
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,640
No choice.

492
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,790
Above and between the eyes.

493
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,870
Shall we start at $5,000?

494
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,260
Special detail, not, say, division.

495
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,080
$15,000.

496
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:45,572
1720 T.

497
00:36:45,573 --> 00:37:09,312
$21.

498
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:11,440
Any advance on $5,000?

499
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,380
$6,000.

500
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:14,420
$6,000.

501
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:17,940
$7,000. 8000. 8000.

502
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:19,204
$8,000.

503
00:37:19,205 --> 00:37:22,548
Any advance on $8,000?

504
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:23,920
$8,000.

505
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,440
9000.

506
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,788
No, not right.

507
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:34,158
Come on, ladies and gentlemen, you don't

508
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,430
usually attend these galas for charity.

509
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,000
You sure there isn't some other reason?

510
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,440
I wish I knew.

511
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,362
But that's two bits of strange behavior

512
00:37:47,363 --> 00:37:49,820
by my mother in two days. Two?

513
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,128
First giving me misinformation about mercenaries and

514
00:37:54,129 --> 00:37:56,758
then attending an auction where you can't

515
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:58,390
possibly buy what's being offered.

516
00:37:58,391 --> 00:38:01,444
Yes, that mercenary business. That was bad.

517
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,830
That was my mistake.

518
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,510
You almost never make a mistake.

519
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,240
Flattery from my own son.

520
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,702
And what's a sudden interest in African art?

521
00:38:17,703 --> 00:38:19,926
Oh, I thought I might enjoy it.

522
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:22,380
Mother, there is a very old quotation.

523
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:23,958
Everything that I enjoy is

524
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:26,348
either illegal, immoral or fattening.

525
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:29,344
I'm not concerned with your weight or your morality.

526
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:31,824
Now, what could be more legal

527
00:38:31,825 --> 00:38:34,120
than attending a public auction?

528
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:38,010
Nothing, as long as that's all you're doing.

529
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:49,460
Attending 17.

530
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,030
Thank you.

531
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,434
The total, ladies and gentlemen, is $1,220,000.

532
00:39:04,435 --> 00:39:09,800
And now for the final item.

533
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:13,710
Lot 24, Nigerian mother and child.

534
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,474
This is one of the finest pieces in

535
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:26,202
the entire sail mother decorated with knock and

536
00:39:26,203 --> 00:39:29,850
shepherd mark on her naked body.

537
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:35,278
And this is your last chance to help you hit

538
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:37,690
that switch that'll blow every fuse in the building.

539
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,198
What'll do to me? I don't really know.

540
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:42,570
It'd be interesting to find out.

541
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,408
Now, don't switch off till 15 seconds

542
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:48,242
after they've been around that corner. Right.

543
00:39:48,243 --> 00:39:49,180
Gotcha.

544
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,140
That's the count to Ashao.

545
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,848
Should be just here when the lights.

546
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,160
Guard, go for the bag.

547
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:20,260
I'll be in the car in 8 seconds.

548
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,260
Would you come with me, please?

549
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,164
Ah, Mr. Holiday.

550
00:41:26,165 --> 00:41:29,284
You are going to slip away with your customary modesty.

551
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:39,658
This is for you, not part of the collection.

552
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:41,402
A token in gratitude.

553
00:41:41,403 --> 00:41:43,800
After all, nearly a million and a half dollars.

554
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,460
And you made it all possible.

555
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,946
Those two other men are figureheads on the committee.

556
00:42:04,947 --> 00:42:07,922
A banker and a businessman to lend respectability.

557
00:42:07,923 --> 00:42:10,754
But Naganda and Jampoti signed the checks.

558
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:13,550
Tomorrow they will make a big cash withdrawal.

559
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:15,584
Won't the bank be suspicious? Why?

560
00:42:15,585 --> 00:42:17,392
Naganda is the man of the moment.

561
00:42:17,393 --> 00:42:18,768
He can also claim that a

562
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,758
cash payment will speed up operations.

563
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:22,052
Oh, I guess he will.

564
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:24,240
Send some medical supplies as cover.

565
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:28,960
Sarah, I got one more chance.

566
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:35,200
That depends on Steve, General.

567
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,600
He insisted on seeing you.

568
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:39,816
Ah, Mr.

569
00:42:39,817 --> 00:42:40,958
Holliday.

570
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:43,096
We're always glad to see our friends.

571
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:44,740
Maybe not this time, General.

572
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,286
The news isn't so good, and it's probably just a rumor.

573
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:49,916
But I thought I'd better tell you because

574
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:52,012
I got the information from the same people

575
00:42:52,013 --> 00:42:53,906
that helped me recover your collection.

576
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:55,084
What information?

577
00:42:55,085 --> 00:42:57,468
They say that there's going to be

578
00:42:57,469 --> 00:43:00,086
an attempt to stop your medical shipment.

579
00:43:00,087 --> 00:43:02,912
I think it's about time you revealed your sources, Mr.

580
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:03,734
Holliday.

581
00:43:03,735 --> 00:43:06,160
Oh, I couldn't do that. I'm sorry.

582
00:43:06,161 --> 00:43:07,820
Then you're wasting my time.

583
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:09,632
All right.

584
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:13,296
General, there's a group of emigrates from your country

585
00:43:13,297 --> 00:43:16,842
who claim your charity gala is a swindle. That's a lie.

586
00:43:16,843 --> 00:43:18,186
Just a minute, Jumboti.

587
00:43:18,187 --> 00:43:20,394
That's a very wild statement, holiday.

588
00:43:20,395 --> 00:43:21,492
Well, there's more.

589
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:23,912
They also say that you're going to use the money

590
00:43:23,913 --> 00:43:26,930
to hire mercenaries so you can stage a counter revolution.

591
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,734
Ridiculous.

592
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:32,750
We can't take that seriously.

593
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:34,968
These people are opposed to.

594
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:36,392
You claim to know exactly

595
00:43:36,393 --> 00:43:38,254
where you've hidden your supplies.

596
00:43:38,255 --> 00:43:40,402
Now they intend to hijack the supplies.

597
00:43:40,403 --> 00:43:42,620
If they can't do that, they'll blow them sky high.

598
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:44,066
That's why you should go to the police.

599
00:43:44,067 --> 00:43:47,682
I appreciate your telling me, but it's all lies.

600
00:43:47,683 --> 00:43:49,964
My enemy is trying to discredit me.

601
00:43:49,965 --> 00:43:51,470
Do me a favor.

602
00:43:51,471 --> 00:43:53,222
Don't spread these rumors.

603
00:43:53,223 --> 00:43:55,056
Any feller, I'm on your side.

604
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:57,232
I thought I'd proved that. Of course.

605
00:43:57,233 --> 00:43:59,232
But it's just idle talk.

606
00:43:59,233 --> 00:44:01,892
There's nothing to worry about. Goodbye, Mr.

607
00:44:01,893 --> 00:44:03,250
Holliday.

608
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:04,720
Hope you know what you're doing.

609
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,770
I don't trust him.

610
00:44:10,771 --> 00:44:13,030
He's a gullible fool.

611
00:44:13,031 --> 00:44:15,910
But his sources were accurate last time.

612
00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:18,062
If someone's found out where the arms

613
00:44:18,063 --> 00:44:20,792
are stored, what use are they?

614
00:44:20,793 --> 00:44:22,450
Mercenaries without guns.

615
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,808
You'd better move them.

616
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:26,594
Suppose it's a trick?

617
00:44:26,595 --> 00:44:28,570
We can't take that chance.

618
00:44:28,571 --> 00:44:30,844
You supervise it in person.

619
00:44:30,845 --> 00:44:33,532
And don't let anything go wrong.

620
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:36,754
Or a glorious liberation will have its first victim.

621
00:44:36,755 --> 00:44:37,480
Yes?

622
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,350
Leopard to Tiger, heading west.

623
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:26,748
Take over.

624
00:45:26,749 --> 00:45:27,884
It's yours now.

625
00:45:27,885 --> 00:45:29,080
I'll follow you.

626
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,760
Police department, please.

627
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:31,988
There you are.

628
00:47:31,989 --> 00:49:27,622
More home electronics in another seven years.

629
00:49:27,623 --> 00:49:28,348
Manous.

630
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:30,050
I'll be looking out for you.

631
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,738
All said thanks to all of you.

632
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:36,224
I shall be kept very busy down there at Boela.

633
00:49:36,225 --> 00:49:38,410
Oh, you thanked the general for that.

634
00:49:38,411 --> 00:49:40,042
The charity auction really did some

635
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,514
good for his country after all.

636
00:49:41,515 --> 00:49:44,538
More planes, more relief supplies, and all Naganda can

637
00:49:44,539 --> 00:49:46,426
do is smile and pretend he likes it.

638
00:49:46,427 --> 00:49:48,862
Jack, you've missed your plane. Thanks, all of you.

639
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:50,878
The only thing I'm sorry is that after all you

640
00:49:50,879 --> 00:49:52,970
have done, you have got nothing out of it.

641
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,280
Leah.

642
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,730
Well, he's wrong about one thing.

643
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:04,930
Not exactly.

644
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:06,392
Nothing out of edge.

645
00:50:06,393 --> 00:50:09,280
You know that statuette the general gave us?

646
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:13,154
Sold it this morning for 30,000. What? Right.

647
00:50:13,155 --> 00:50:14,674
Which only goes to prove you got

648
00:50:14,675 --> 00:50:16,030
to win some of the time.

649
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,490
You sa.
